Mutation of the NF-kappaB site did not affect IL-2 expression, whereas mutation of the AP-1 site or PKC depletion almost revoked IL-2 release.

PKCalpha regulates phosphorylation of NF-kappaB p65 at Ser276.

The functional interaction between Foxp3 and CREB did not affect the DNA-binding activity of CREB-1, but did show a modest decrease in activating transcription factor 2 (ATF-2) DNA-binding activity in the presence of forskolin as determined by transcription factor ELISA (Figure 7B).
('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'activating transcription factor 2'),('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'CREB-1')

To determine whether Foxp3 can disrupt the function/recruitment of the coactivator protein p300, we introduced a Gal4 reporter vector and a Gal4-BD-CREB-1 expression vector into HEK 293T cells in the absence or presence of Foxp3, p300, and/or control expression vectors (Figure 7C).
('p300', 'Transcription', 'Gal4-BD-CREB-1'),('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'CREB-1'),('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'p300'),('p300', 'Binding', 'p300'),('Foxp3', 'Positive_regulation', 'Gal4-BD-CREB-1')

As expected, p300 overexpression stimulated transcription of the Gal4-BD-CREB-1 fusion protein.
('p300', 'Transcription', 'Gal4-BD-CREB-1')

Foxp3, again, repressed basal levels of Gal4-BD-CREB-1 activation by more than 2-fold, while effectively neutralizing Gal4-BD-CREB-1 activation in the presence of p300.
('p300', 'Transcription', 'Gal4-BD-CREB-1'),('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'CREB-1'),('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'p300'),('Foxp3', 'Positive_regulation', 'Gal4-BD-CREB-1')

Overexpression of Foxp3 failed to reduce the detectable levels of CREB phosphorylation using a phosphospecific antibody for CREB-1 (unpublished data).
('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'CREB-1')

However, when we attempted to determine whether Foxp3 could physically interact with the coactivator protein p300, we found that p300 immunoprecipitated Foxp3 when both proteins were overexpressed in HEK 293T cells (Figure 7D).
('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'p300'),('p300', 'Binding', 'p300')

Collectively, these results suggest that Foxp3 antagonizes CREB-dependent gene expression by directly interacting with coactivator p300 and interfering with its function and/or recruitment to CREB-responsive promoter sequences.

LMP1 Activates Akt Signaling and Deregulates the Rb Cell Cycle Pathway
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'Akt')

LMP1 transformation of rodent fibroblasts requires activation of PI3K and Akt [5].
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'Akt')

To determine if Akt signaling is activated in LMP1 transgenic mice, pAkt and several of its targets were assessed by immunoblotting of splenic CD19+ MACS-purified B cells.
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'Akt')

LMP1 transgenic B cells had increased levels of pAkt compared to wild-type lymphocytes; however, progression to lymphoma in both LMP1-positive and -negative lymphoma cells did not further increase pAkt levels.
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'Akt')

This finding indicates that GSK3 is not a target of activated Akt in the LMP1 transgenic lymphocytes and lymphoma cells.
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'Akt')

Activated p-mTOR was not increased in LMP1 transgenic lymphocytes or lymphoma cells, indicating that this pathway is not affected by LMP1-induced Akt activation and does not contribute to lymphoma development (Figure 6B).
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'Akt')

Immunoblot analysis indicated that total FoxO1 levels were greatly decreased in wild-type and LMP1 transgenic lymphomas (Figure 6B), suggesting that inhibition of the Forkhead signaling pathway is an important target of Akt in lymphoma development.
('Akt', 'Negative_regulation', 'FoxO1'),('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'Akt')

However, considering that Akt activation did not induce FoxO1 degradation in LMP1 transgenic B cells, Akt may not be the sole regulator of FoxO1, and it may be that progression to lymphoma requires modulation of multiple pathways.

IL-10 Production by Th1 Cells Is Dependent on STAT4 but Not on STAT6, IFN-gamma, or IL-4 Signaling
('STAT6', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('STAT4', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('STAT6', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-4'),('IFN-gamma', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('STAT4', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-4'),('STAT4', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IFN-gamma', 'Localization', 'IL-4')

To further elucidate the mechanisms required for the development of Th1 cells producing IL-10, we investigated the role of STAT4, one of the signaling pathways activated by IL-12 (Murphy et al., 2000).
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('STAT4', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Again, IL-10-producing Th1 cells were differentiated at the high antigen dose in the presence of IL-12 in DO11.10 T cells (Figure 2A).
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

In contrast, in the absence of STAT4, the percentage of cells expressing IFN-gamma was dramatically diminished as expected and resulted in an increase in the percentage of cells expressing IL-4, but not IL-10 (Figure 2A), suggesting that STAT4 contributes to IL-10 expression by Th1 cells.
('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('STAT4', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('IFN-gamma', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('STAT4', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-4'),('STAT4', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IFN-gamma', 'Localization', 'IL-4')

Because IL-10 expression is associated with an IL-4-induced Th2 cell phenotype, we investigated whether the differentiation of the IL-10-producing Th1 cells depended on signaling through the IL-4 receptor via STAT6 activation (Glimcher and Murphy, 2000; Murphy et al., 2000).
('STAT6', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('STAT6', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-4')

The absence of STAT6 did not impair the differentiation of IL-10-producing Th1 cells in the presence of IL-12 and OVA (Figure 2A).
('STAT6', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('OVA', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

In fact, a higher percentage of STAT6-deficient cells compared with WT cells produced both IL-10 and IFN-gamma (Figure 2A), which may be the result of the loss of Th2 cell control over a Th1 cell response.
('STAT6', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IFN-gamma', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

As expected, lack of STAT6 abrogated both IL-4 and IL-10 production by T cells developed with IL-4 or with low antigen dose (Figures 2B and 2C).
('STAT6', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('STAT6', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-4')

However, in the absence of STAT4 signaling, IL-10 and IL-4 production by Th2 cells was if anything increased (Figures 2B and 2C).
('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('STAT4', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-4'),('STAT4', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Thus, in contrast to what was observed under Th1 conditions, IL-10 expression by Th2 cells depended on STAT6, but not on STAT4, signaling (Figures 2B and 2C).
('STAT6', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('STAT4', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

To investigate whether the inability of STAT4-deficient T cells to produce IL-10 might be due to the absence of IFN-gamma, as suggested before (Shaw et al., 2006), we differentiated DO11.10 or DO11.10 IFN-gamma-deficient naive CD4+ T cells in the presence of IL-12 and increasing doses of OVA.
('OVA', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IFN-gamma', 'Regulation', 'IL-12'),('STAT4', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('IFN-gamma', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('STAT4', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

The secretion of IL-10 as induced by high antigen dose, and IL-12 was not affected by an absence of IFN-gamma (Figure 2D), showing that the expression of IL-10 by Th1 cells is independent of IFN-gamma.
('IFN-gamma', 'Regulation', 'IL-12'),('IFN-gamma', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

In the absence of IFN-gamma, we observed an increase in the secreted IL-4 as expected (data not shown).
('IFN-gamma', 'Localization', 'IL-4')

We also tested for any potential role of IL-4 in the development of Th1 cells producing IL-10 by culturing DO11.10 or DO11.10 IL-4-deficient naive CD4+ T cells with IL-12 and increasing doses of antigen.
('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

As observed in the absence of STAT6 (Figure 2A), IL-4 deficiency had no effect on the development of Th1 cells producing IL-10 (Figure 2E), but compromised the development of Th2 cells producing IL-10 (Figure 2F).
('STAT6', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('STAT6', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-4')

Thus, our data suggested that IL-10 production by Th1 or Th2 cells was dependent on the specific signaling pathways required for their differentiation, given that STAT4 is required for the induction of IL-10 production by Th1 cells and STAT6 for Th2 cells.
('STAT6', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('STAT4', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

IL-10 Production by Th1 Cells Requires ERK1 and ERK2 Activation
('ERK2', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('ERK1', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10')

Our data showed that the maintenance of IL-10 induction in Th1 cells required stimulation with high antigen dose, which to some extent could be compensated for by the addition of IL-12.
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Although the apparent peak and amount of ERK1 and ERK2 activation varied slightly between experiments, a consistent finding was that high antigen dose differentiated Th1 cells always showed enhanced and prolonged ERK1 and ERK2 activation in the presence of IL-12, regardless of whether they were restimulated with high or low antigen dose (Figure 5B).
('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'ERK1'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'ERK2')

We then investigated whether ERK1 and ERK2 activation was required for the induction of IL-10 in Th1 cells by using U0126 (Figure 5C), a compound that blocks downstream ERK activation.
('ERK2', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('ERK1', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10')

As in the APC-driven cultures, stronger TCR stimulation together with IL-12 led to higher percentages of cells producing both IL-10 and IFN-gamma after 1 week of culture (Figure 5C).
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Because U0126 inhibits the MEK5-catalyzed activation of ERK5, as well as the MEK1- and MEK2-catalyzed activation of ERK1 and ERK2 (Bain et al., 2007; Mody et al., 2001), we also used the more specific, structurally unrelated MEK1 and MEK2 inhibitor PD184352 at concentrations in which it inhibits MEK1 and MEK2 but not MEK5 (Bain et al., 2007; Mody et al., 2001).
('MEK2', 'Positive_regulation', 'ERK1'),('MEK5', 'Positive_regulation', 'ERK5'),('MEK1', 'Positive_regulation', 'ERK2'),('MEK1', 'Positive_regulation', 'ERK1'),('MEK2', 'Positive_regulation', 'ERK2')

Upon addition of inhibitors to other signaling pathways, including a p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB203580, or the GSK3beta inhibitor, CT99021 (Bain et al., 2007), no effect on IL-10 production was observed (Figure S5B).
('p38 MAPK', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('GSK3beta', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Our data thus suggested that IL-10 production by Th1 cells in response to high antigen dose and IL-12 requires ERK1 and ERK2 signaling, but not the activation of the p38 or the GSK3beta pathways.
('ERK2', 'Positive_regulation', 'p38'),('ERK2', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('ERK1', 'Positive_regulation', 'GSK3beta'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'ERK1'),('ERK2', 'Positive_regulation', 'GSK3beta'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'ERK2'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('ERK1', 'Positive_regulation', 'p38'),('GSK3beta', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('ERK1', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10')

Here, we showed that Th1 cells required high-antigen-dose-induced ERK1 and ERK2 phosphorylation and IL-12-induced STAT-4 activation to produce IL-10.
('ERK1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('ERK', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'STAT-4'),('STAT-4', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('ERK2', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Our findings that ERK1 and ERK2 activation was a common pathway required for the production of IL-10 by Th1, Th2, and Th17 cell subsets, which differentiate along distinct pathways, such that IL-10 provides a highly regulated feedback loop to avoid the extremes of excessive inflammation or chronic infections and also allow a protective response to diverse pathogens.
('ERK1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('ERK', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('IL-10', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('ERK2', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Under these conditions, we speculate that Th1 cells will be induced to express high amounts of IL-10, in keeping with reports that IL-10-producing Th1 cells were found in CD4+ clones isolated from BAL but not blood of TB patients (Gerosa et al., 1999).
('IL-10', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Similarly, the immune response to a clinical isolate of L. major, which produces heavily infected nonhealing lesions, was found to be regulated by IL-10 derived from Foxp3- Th1 cells that coproduce IL-10 and IFN-gamma (Anderson et al., 2007), and the immune response during T. gondii infection was found also to be regulated by Foxp3- Th1 cells (Jankovic et al., 2007).
('IL-10', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IFN-gamma', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10')

It is likely that IL-10 production by Th1 cells is evoked under conditions of high inflammation and antigenic stimulation, whereas regulatory CD4+ T cells producing IL-10 may operate to regulate the immune response under conditions in which the pathogen is clinically controlled, such as in infection with L. major (Friedlin strain) (Belkaid et al., 2002; Suffia et al., 2006).
('IL-10', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

We now also reported that CD4+ T cells cultured with high antigen dose and IL-12 differentiate into canonical Th1 effector cells, which, in addition to expressing large amounts of IFN-gamma and IL-10, lose their IL-2 expression as described before in certain chronic infection models (Sallusto et al., 2004).
('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('IFN-gamma', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

We showed here that this induction of IL-10 in Th1 cells in vivo was markedly, but not totally, reduced in STAT4-deficient T cells as observed during T. gondii infection (Jankovic et al., 2002).
('STAT4', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10')

A high antigenic activation during T. gondii infection or high antigen doses delivered in the presence of LPS, as seen in our system, may compensate for an absolute requirement for IL-12 in the induction of IL-10 by Th1 cells.
('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

In our in vitro system, repeated stimulation of Th1 cells with high antigen doses allowed the development of Th1 cells producing IL-10 in an IL-12-dependent manner.
('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

IL-10 production by Th1 cells induced by high antigen dose and IL-12 was independent of IFN-gamma, in keeping with previous findings (Jankovic et al., 2002).
('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('IFN-gamma', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

However, a role for IFN-gamma in mediating IL-10 reactivation by Th1 cells during secondary infection with T. gondii has been suggested (Shaw et al., 2006).
('IFN-gamma', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10')

We have found that CD4+ T cells exposed to a high dose of antigen do not express IL-10 upon restimulation, but can be induced to produce IL-10 upon re-exposure to a high dose of antigen in the recall phase in the absence of added IL-12.
('IL-10', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

The combination of both high antigen dose and IL-12 resulted in the highest levels of IL-10 production and correlated with the high levels of ERK1 and ERK2 activation.
('ERK1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('ERK', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('ERK2', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

It is thus likely that in T. gondii infection in vivo (Shaw et al., 2006), the requirement for IFN-gamma to induce IL-10, was for feedback upregulation of IL-12 by DCs, which in turn induced IL-10 in the Th1 cells.
('IL-10', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('IFN-gamma', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Costimulatory OX-40 signals have been shown to negatively regulate IL-10 production (Ito et al., 2005) both in Th1 and Th2 cells, whereas ICOS signaling has been suggested to induce IL-10 (Ito et al., 2007; Witsch et al., 2002) in both Th1 and Th2 cells.
('IL-10', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

We now provide a common mechanism of ERK1 and ERK2 activation for the regulation of IL-10 production in Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells, although each subset differentiates along a distinct and subset-specific transcriptional pathway.
('ERK1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('ERK', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('ERK2', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Of note, a role for ERK1 and ERK2 activation in the induction of IL-10 production has already been described for macrophages and DC (Agrawal et al., 2006; Hacker et al., 1999).
('ERK1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('ERK', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('ERK2', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Differential transcriptional regulation of IL-10 in Th1 and Th2 cells has been suggested (Chang et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2005), and extensive histone acetylation of the IL-10 gene is detectable in fully polarized Th2 cells, but not Th1 cells (Chang et al., 2007).
('IL-10', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

We provide evidence that IL-10 is produced in canonical Th1 cells and that its expression correlates with the expression of T-bet and the highest IFN-gamma production, in keeping with our observations that high-dose antigen stimulation and IL-12 signaling are required for IL-10 and IFN-gamma expression.
('IL-10', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('IFN-gamma', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

It has also been shown that maintenance of IL-10 expression is conditional on IL-12 or IL-4 unless the IL-10 gene is imprinted by GATA-3 (Chang et al., 2007), which can remodel the IL-10 locus, thus explaining the highest amounts of IL-10 produced by Th2 cells (Chang et al., 2007; Shoemaker et al., 2006).
('IL-10', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

We show here that high antigen dose and IL-12 drastically downregulate Gata-3 expression, suggesting that additional factors are in place to induce IL-10 expression in Th1 cells, albeit transiently.
('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'Gata-3'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Expression of c-maf was greatly diminished by high antigen doses in T cells and yet was unexpectedly maintained by IL-12 and present in Th17 cells.
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'c-maf')

That c-maf expression is common to IL-10-producing Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells and, like IL-10, is dependent on ERK activation in Th1 and Th17 cells for its expression is of interest because c-Maf has been shown to be an essential transcription factor for IL-10 expression in macrophages (Cao et al., 2005).
('ERK', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('IL-10', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('ERK', 'Gene_expression', 'c-maf'),('c-Maf', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

ERK1 and ERK2 activation is required for IL-10 production by all these Th cell subsets.
('ERK1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('ERK', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('ERK2', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

With regard to the expression of IL-10 by Th1 cells, our data provide a mechanism for how IL-10 expression is induced and then amplified and regulated by the levels of antigen and IL-12 encountered in the environment.
('IL-10', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

LMP1 Upregulates IL10 and Constitutively Activates Stat3
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL10'),('IL10', 'Positive_regulation', 'Stat3')

Transcription of IL10, IL15, and IFNgamma were reproducibly detected in LMP1 transgenic lymphocytes and lymphoma cells and was higher than in the B cell lymphoma cell lines 967 and K46mu (Figure 5A).
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL10'),('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'IFNgamma'),('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL15')

There was no significant difference in the expression of IL15 and IFNgamma between LMP1 transgenic lymphocytes and lymphoma cells, suggesting that upregulation of IL15 and IFNgamma is induced by LMP1 expression in healthy lymphocytes but is not a unique property of malignant lymphocytes.
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'IFNgamma'),('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL15')

Strikingly, IL10, a B lymphocyte stimulatory cytokine, was increased 1.5- to 5-fold in the wild-type and LMP1 transgenic lymphoma cells compared to LMP1 transgenic lymphocytes (Figure 5A).
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL10')

Immunoblot analysis indicated that LMP1 transgenic lymphocytes and wild-type and LMP1 transgenic lymphoma cells had corresponding increased levels of phosphorylated alpha and beta isoforms of activated Stat3, a target of the IL10 receptor (Figure 5B).
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL10'),('IL10', 'Positive_regulation', 'Stat3')

However, when comparing the same lymphomas, there was no correlation between the levels of IL10 induction and the levels of Stat3 activation.
('IL10', 'Positive_regulation', 'Stat3')

This suggests that the activation of Stat3 is not solely induced by IL10 or that Stat3 activation may be constitutive.
('IL10', 'Positive_regulation', 'Stat3')

Additionally, there was no correlation between the levels of LMP1 expression and the levels of IL10 induction (Figures 1A and 5A).
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL10')

This indicates that the induction of IL10 is a general property associated with enhanced survival and may only be indirectly affected by LMP1.
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL10')

Neutralizing antibodies to IL10 did not affect the survival of lymphoma cells as determined by the MTS assay (unpublished data), suggesting constitutive activation of Stat3.
('IL10', 'Positive_regulation', 'Stat3')

This was confirmed by immunoblot analysis such that in the presence of anti-IL10 neutralizing antibodies, pStat3 levels remained activated in lymphoma cells isolated from wild-type and LMP1 transgenic lymphomas (Figure 5C).
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL10'),('IL10', 'Positive_regulation', 'pStat3'),('IL10', 'Positive_regulation', 'Stat3')

Exogenous addition of IL10 enhanced pStat3 activation above constitutive levels, indicating that lymphoma cells are responsive to IL10 treatment (Figure 5C).
('IL10', 'Positive_regulation', 'pStat3'),('IL10', 'Positive_regulation', 'Stat3')

This means that although the lymphoma cells have constitutive Stat3 activation, it may be further enhanced by IL10 induction.
('IL10', 'Positive_regulation', 'Stat3')

Nuclear translocation of pStat3 is a consequence of activation, and nuclear pStat3 was not detected by immunohistochemistry staining of spleen sections from control mice.

Pam3CYS-matured WT BMDC induced robust IFNgamma production at a significantly higher level than cpdm BMDC (Fig.
('Pam3CYS', 'Gene_expression', 'IFNgamma')

Two allelic, autosomal recessive mutations in the Sharpin gene occurred spontaneously in two inbred strains of mice, C57B/KaLawRij-Sharpincpdm/Sharpincpdm and CBy.Ocb3/Dem-Sharpincpdm-Dem/Sharpincpdm-Dem, resulting in premature termination of mRNA synthesis and absence of a functional protein product [2].
('Sharpin', 'Negative_regulation', 'Sharpin')

There are accumulations of eosinophils, neutrophils and macrophages in the skin of Sharpincpdm/Sharpincpdm mutant mice (hereafter referred to as cpdm mice) associated with increased expression of Th2 cytokines in the skin and in the supernatants of activated splenocytes [5].

IL-10 Production Is Maintained by High TCR Signal Strength and IL-12
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10')

We next investigated whether repeated strong TCR activation is a compensatory signal for IL-12-induced STAT4 signaling in the induction of IL-10 in Th1 cells.
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10')

High antigen dose and IL-12 cooperated to induce maximal IL-10 production (Figures 4A and 4B), given that this combination resulted in the highest numbers of IL-10-producing Th1 cells.
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10')

Repeated high antigen dose stimulation in the absence of exogenously added IL-12 resulted in the production of IL-10 by Th1 cells, suggesting that repeated strong TCR triggering may overcome the need for IL-12 for IL-10 induction (Figures 4C and 4D).
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10')

However, IL-10 induction under these conditions was abrogated when IL-12p40-deficient DCs were used as APCs (Figure 4E).
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12p40', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10')

Thus, IL-12 is essential during both primary and secondary antigenic stimulation for production of IL-10 by Th1 cells.
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10')

To determine the requirements for stability of the IL-10-producing Th1 cells, we differentiated CD4+ T cells for 1 week with high antigen doses with or without IL-12 (Figures 4A and 4C), washed them, and then restimulated them for an additional week with a low antigen dose, in the absence or presence of IL-12 (Figure 4F).
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10')

Th1 cells induced in the first week to produce IL-10 by culture with high antigen doses and IL-12 lost their ability to express IL-10 when recultured with low doses of OVA, which could be compensated for, to some extent, by addition of IL-12 to the secondary cultures (Figure 4F), again suggesting that antigen dose and IL-12 signals cooperate for the induction of IL-10.
('OVA', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10')

Finally, DO11.10 CD4+ cells that were exposed to low doses of antigen and IL-12 during the primary differentiation phase produced high amounts of IFN-gamma but little IL-10, but they could be induced to produce IL-10 when both high antigen dose and IL-12 were present during the recall phase (Figure S4).
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10')

Thus, high antigen dose and IL-12 are required for sustaining the induction of IL-10 production by Th1 cells.

As shown in Figure 7D, expression of KD-PKCalpha in RAW 264.7 cells did not affect the constitutive phosphorylation at Ser536 of NF-kappaB p65, but attenuated the phosphorylation at Ser276.
('PKCalpha', 'Phosphorylation', 'p65')

These observations demonstrate that PKCalpha is important in M-CSF-regulated cell survival and NF-kappaB activation and likely regulated through phosphorylation of Ser276 of NF-kappaB p65.
('PKCalpha', 'Phosphorylation', 'p65')

To further validate the impact that PKCalpha played in M-CSF-induced NF-kappaB transcriptional activity, we next employed PKCalpha siRNA treatment of MDM or RAW cells.
('PKCalpha siRNA', 'Gene_expression', 'PKCalpha')

A pool of specific PKCalpha siRNA were transfected into MDM or Raw 264.7 cells in the presence or absence or M-CSF.
('PKCalpha siRNA', 'Gene_expression', 'PKCalpha')

We also examined cell survival of the MDMs by Annexin V-FITC and PI staining after PKCalpha siRNA transfection.
('PKCalpha siRNA', 'Gene_expression', 'PKCalpha')

As shown in Figure 7G, M-CSF-induced MDM survival was reduced in the cells transfected with PKCalpha siRNA compared with cells transfected with control siRNA (p = 0.047).
('PKCalpha siRNA', 'Gene_expression', 'PKCalpha')

In Figure 7H, we confirmed that PKCalpha siRNA transfection decreased PKCalpha protein expression in both MDM and Raw 264.7 cells.
('PKCalpha siRNA', 'Gene_expression', 'PKCalpha')

Finally, comparison of the percent Foxp3+CD4+CD25+ T cells to the HTLV-I proviral load in HTLV-I-infected asymptomatic carriers and patients with HTLV-I-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis suggested that high Foxp3 expression is associated with low proviral load and absence of disease.
('Foxp3', 'Localization', 'Foxp3'),('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'Foxp3')

The defective NF-kappaB activation by both stimuli suggests that the Sharpin mutation interferes with the protein adaptors or kinases shared by both signaling pathways, such as RIP1 and TRAF6 [18].
('Sharpin', 'Ubiquitination', 'RIP1')

Our results indicate that the protein HOIP is critical for CD40-induced signals that regulate B cell function.
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40')

Our data show that HOIP-dependent cellular responses include CD40-mediated upregulation of CD80 expression and synthesis of germline RNA transcripts from the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus, two events that are important for T-cell-dependent antibody-mediated immune responses.
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40')

At the molecular level, our data indicate that HOIP functions downstream of TRAF2 in the CD40 signaling pathway and that HOIP has a key role in promoting the recruitment of the IKK complex to CD40.
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40'),('TRAF2', 'Binding', 'HOIP')

Consistent with this, CD40-induced activation of NF-kappaB is dependent on the presence of HOIP.
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40')

In addition, our data show that HOIP facilitates the activation of JNK in response to CD40 engagement.
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40')

Together, our findings provide support for the conclusion that HOIP is a key component of the CD40 signaling pathway.
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40')

Given the importance of CD40 signaling in both cellular and humoral immune responses, our results indicate that HOIP has a critical role in the regulation of the immune system.
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40')

Subsequent studies showed that a HOIP-containing complex can interact with IKKgamma and facilitate activation of NF-kappaB via the canonical pathway [16].
('HOIP', 'Positive_regulation', 'IKKgamma')

These data, considered together with ours, suggest that a HOIP-containing complex mediates recruitment of IKKgamma to the CD40 signaling complex.
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40'),('HOIP', 'Positive_regulation', 'IKKgamma')

In addition, CD40-associated HOIP could play a role in activating IKKgamma after its recruitment to the signaling complex [16].
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40'),('HOIP', 'Positive_regulation', 'IKKgamma')

The higher molecular weight forms of IKKgamma we observed in CD40 immunoprecipitates would be consistent with the presence of post-transcriptional modifications including phosphorylation and ubiquitination, which have been suggested to reduce or enhance IKKgamma activity, respectively [16], [17].
('IKKgamma', 'Positive_regulation', 'IKKgamma'),('IKKgamma', 'Negative_regulation', 'IKKgamma')

The mechanisms by which HOIP mediates recruitment of the IKK complex to CD40 and by which HOIP is recruited to CD40 remain unclear.
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40')

A previous study indicates that HOIP may mediate direct contacts with the IKK complex [16], suggesting that it functions as an adaptor for the recruitment of the IKK complex to CD40.
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40')

As IKKgamma appears capable of binding linear polyubiquitin [18], [19], it is possible that HOIP directs formation of linear polyubiquitin chains on a CD40-associated factor, and it is these chains that serve to recruit IKKgamma to the CD40 signaling complex.
('IKKgamma', 'Positive_regulation', 'IKKgamma'),('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40'),('IKKgamma', 'Negative_regulation', 'IKKgamma'),('HOIP', 'Positive_regulation', 'IKKgamma')

The molecular interactions necessary for recruitment of HOIP itself to the CD40 signaling complex also remain to be fully characterized.
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40')

We previously showed that the recruitment of HOIP to the signaling complex is TRAF2-dependent [8].
('TRAF2', 'Binding', 'HOIP')

Potentially, TRAF2 and HOIP directly interact, but it is possible that the ubiquitin ligase activity of TRAF2 [20] (or TRAF2-associated proteins, such as the cIAPs [21]) generates K63-linked polyubiquitin chains to which HOIP can bind and thus associate with the CD40 signaling complex [22].
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40'),('TRAF2', 'Binding', 'HOIP')

While our previous work indicated a potentially important link between TRAF2 and HOIP in CD40 signaling, the signals and functions tested here are dependent upon TRAF6 as well as TRAF2.
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40'),('TRAF2', 'Binding', 'HOIP')

HOIP deficiency compromises the CD40-mediated activation of both NF-kappaB and JNK, indicating that signals mediated by both TRAF2 and TRAF6 likely pass through HOIP.
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40'),('TRAF2', 'Binding', 'HOIP')

Although the experiments presented here focus on CD40, our results and those of other groups [16], [22] support the possibility that HOIP is important in many signaling pathways in which TRAF2 or TRAF6 are involved, including those associated with various members of the TNF receptor superfamily and the Toll-like receptors.
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40'),('TRAF2', 'Binding', 'HOIP')

We also found that the recruitment of HOIP to CD40 was TRAF2-dependent and that overexpression of a truncated HOIP mutant partially inhibited CD40-mediated NF-kappaB activation.
('TRAF2', 'Binding', 'HOIP')

However, stimulated SHARPIN-deficient BMDC had reduced transcription and secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators IL6, IL12P70, GMCSF, and nitric oxide.

Wild-Type and LMP1 Transgenic Lymphoma Cells Do Not Require IL4 and Stat6 Signaling
('IL4', 'Phosphorylation', 'Stat6')

Activated Stat6 (pStat6), a target of the IL4 receptor pathway, was detected in the wild-type and LMP1 transgenic lymphocytes (Figure 4B).
('IL4', 'Phosphorylation', 'Stat6')

However, the pathway was not disabled, as treatment of the lymphoma cells with IL4 induced Stat6 phosphorylation (Figure 4C).
('IL4', 'Phosphorylation', 'Stat6')

In summary, the wild-type and LMP1 transgenic lymphoma cells grew independently of IL4 treatment and did not require Stat6 signaling.
('IL4', 'Phosphorylation', 'Stat6')

IL-10 Production by Th2 and Th17 Cells Also Requires ERK1 and ERK2 Activation
('ERK2', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('ERK1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

To address whether IL-10 production by Th2 and Th17 cells was also dependent on ERK1 and ERK2 activation, we differentiated these cells with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 in the absence of APCs (Shoemaker et al., 2006; Veldhoen et al., 2009; Veldhoen et al., 2006), in the presence or absence of the MEK inhibitor (PD184352).
('ERK2', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('ERK1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('MEK', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

We showed that ERK1 and ERK2 activation is a common pathway required for induction of IL-10 in different Th cell subsets because IL-10 production by both Th2 and Th17 cells was markedly inhibited in the presence of the MEK inhibitor (PD184352) (Figure 5D and Figure S5B).
('ERK2', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('ERK1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('MEK', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Activation of the ERK1 and ERK2 signaling pathway is therefore a common requirement for the induction of IL-10 production by Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells.
('ERK2', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('ERK1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

To address the mechanisms regulating IL-10 production by Th1 cells in vivo, we transferred DO11.10 cells into BALB/c recipient mice and immunized the recipients with very high doses of OVA-protein with or without added lipopolysacharide (LPS).
('OVA', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

This in vivo immunization induced IL-10 and IFN-gamma production, and the amount of IL-10 production was enhanced by addition of LPS in the immunization (Figure 3A) and with higher doses of OVA (3 muM versus 1 muM, data not shown).
('OVA', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

To test the role of STAT4 and STAT6 signaling in the in vivo development of IL-10-producing Th1 cells, we transferred STAT4- or STAT6-deficient or WT DO11.10 cells into recipient BALB/c mice and immunized with OVA-protein plus LPS as before.
('OVA', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Functional inactivation of Foxp3 by genetic mutations affecting the Foxp3 coding region, as demonstrated in IPEX, or repression of Foxp3 expression by the HTLV-I-encoded transactivator protein Tax, as recently reported in patients with HAM/TSP, results in loss of regulatory activity in CD4+CD25hi T cells [4,8,17].
('Foxp3', 'Localization', 'Foxp3'),('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'Foxp3'),('Foxp3', 'Negative_regulation', 'Foxp3'),('Tax', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3')

Although it is clear that Foxp3 regulates T cell proliferation and cytokine production, very little is known concerning the molecular mechanisms of Foxp3 function.
('Foxp3', 'Localization', 'Foxp3'),('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'Foxp3'),('Foxp3', 'Negative_regulation', 'Foxp3')

The first evidence to indicate how Foxp3 promotes the development and function of regulatory T cells came from a report by Ziegler and colleagues [16], which suggested that Foxp3 could inhibit transcriptional activation by physically interacting with forkhead binding sites located immediately adjacent to critical cis-acting NF-AT binding sites found in various cytokine promoters (e.g., IL-2 promoter).
('Foxp3', 'Localization', 'Foxp3'),('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'Foxp3'),('Foxp3', 'Negative_regulation', 'Foxp3'),('Foxp3', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-2')

A recent study by Bettelli and colleagues [15] further demonstrated that Foxp3 could inhibit NF-AT as well as NF-kappaB activation, although the mechanism of suppression was shown to involve direct protein-protein interactions between NF-AT or NF-kappaB and Foxp3 rather than binding of Foxp3 to promoter elements adjacent to cis-acting NF-AT or NF-kappaB sites.
('Foxp3', 'Localization', 'Foxp3'),('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'Foxp3'),('Foxp3', 'Negative_regulation', 'Foxp3')

In the present study, we expanded upon these observations by defining additional requirements of Foxp3-mediated repression of NF-kappaB activation, and investigated whether Foxp3 could target additional signaling pathways by examining transcriptional activation of NF-kappaB-dependent and NF-kappaB-independent retroviral pathogens.
('Foxp3', 'Localization', 'Foxp3'),('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'Foxp3'),('Foxp3', 'Negative_regulation', 'Foxp3')

The characterization of the molecular targets of Foxp3 and the mechanism(s) utilized by Foxp3 to support Treg development and function will aid in our understanding of the role Tregs play in the pathogenesis of human autoimmune disease.

We show that effector CTL differentiation occurs in two sequential phases in vitro, characterized by early induction of T-bet and late induction of Eomesodermin (Eomes), T-box transcription factors that regulate the early and late phases of interferon (IFN) gamma expression, respectively.
('Eomesodermin', 'Gene_expression', 'interferon (IFN) gamma'),('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'interferon (IFN) gamma')

Interleukin-10 Production by Th1 Cells Requires Interleukin-12-Induced STAT4 Transcription Factor and ERK MAP Kinase Activation by High Antigen Dose
('ERK', 'Gene_expression', 'Interleukin-10'),('STAT4', 'Gene_expression', 'Interleukin-10')

We showed that development of IL-10-producing Th1 cells required high T cell receptor (TCR) ligation, sustained ERK1 and ERK2 MAP kinases phosphorylation, and IL-12-induced STAT4 transcription factor activation.
('ERK2', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'STAT4'),('ERK1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Although Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells require the activation of distinct STATs for their differentiation, activation of ERK1 and ERK2 was a common requirement for production of IL-10 by all Th cell subsets.

Runx3 controls Eomes, perforin, granzyme B, and IFN-gamma expression in effector CTLs.
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'granzyme B'),('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'Eomes'),('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma')

Runx3+/+ or Runx3-/- CD8+ T cells were activated and transduced with retroviruses bearing an empty IRES-GFP cassette (GFP) or also encoding Eomes-VP16 (Eo-VP16) or Myc-Runx3 (Runx3).
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'Eomes')

T-bet is induced by TCR signals and is essential for early IFN-gamma expression.
('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma')

Runx3 is present in naive CD8+ T cells and represses Runx1 and induces Eomes, perforin, granzyme B, and IFN-gamma expression.
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'granzyme B'),('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'Eomes'),('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma')

Eomes may participate in sustaining late IFN-gamma expression, whereas Runx3 and Eomes (but not T-bet) may cooperate to activate perforin expression.
('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'Eomes'),('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma')

Consistent with these findings the dominant negative PKCalpha constructs also inhibited NF-kappaB p65 phosphorylation at Ser276 but not at Ser536 resulting in reduced NF-kappaB transcriptional activation and M-CSF-induced MDM survival.
('PKCalpha', 'Phosphorylation', 'p65'),('dominant negative PKCalpha', 'Phosphorylation', 'p65')

Finally, in a NF-kappaB p65-/- fibroblast cell line, we confirmed that the Ser276 residue of NF-kappaB p65 is important and essential for PKC modulation of NF-kappaB activity.
('p65', 'Binding', 'p65'),('p65', 'Positive_regulation', 'p65')

Notably, in addition to phosphorylating Ser276 of NF-kappaB, our study revealed that M-CSF also modulated the phosphorylation of the NF-kappaB p65 subunit at Ser536, however, PKC inhibitors or kinase deficient PKCalpha constructs did not affect this phosphorylation event.
('PKCalpha', 'Phosphorylation', 'p65')

Moreover, mutant constructs containing a point mutation at Ser536 of NF-kappaB p65 did not reduce NF-kappaB activity in cells lacking endogenous NF-kappaB p65, while the NF-kappaB p65 276S/A construct did reduce NF-kappaB activity in these cells.
('p65', 'Binding', 'p65'),('p65', 'Positive_regulation', 'p65')

It is notable that M-CSF activated NF-kappaB p65 Ser276 phosphorylation and transcriptional activation in a PKCalpha-dependent manner.
('PKCalpha', 'Phosphorylation', 'p65')

In our studies using conventional PKC inhibitors and dominant negative PKCalpha constructs, PKCalpha was critical in M-CSF-induced macrophage survival by inducing Ser276 phosphorylation of NF-kappaB p65 in both primary human MDMs and Raw 264.7 cells.
('PKCalpha', 'Phosphorylation', 'p65'),('dominant negative PKCalpha', 'Phosphorylation', 'p65')

It has been shown that phosphorylation of p65 at Ser276 prevents its degradation by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis and promotes cell survival in HeLa cells [24].
('ubiquitin', 'Protein_catabolism', 'p65')

We did not find that PKC was involved in IkappaBalpha degradation or NF-kappaB p65 nuclear translocation induced by M-CSF, but that M-CSF-induced phosphorylation of NF-kappaB p65 at Ser276 was dramatically reduced by the conventional PKC inhibitor and kinase deficient PKCalpha and by siRNA towards PKCalpha.
('p65', 'Binding', 'p65'),('PKCalpha', 'Phosphorylation', 'p65'),('p65', 'Positive_regulation', 'p65')

During this process, expression of IKKalpha among other proteins, is elevated leading to increased p52 NF-kappaB (relB) expression through partial proteolytic degradation of the p100 NF-kappaB protein.
('IKKalpha', 'Gene_expression', 'p52')

LMP1 transgenic mice have a higher incidence of lymphoma [26] and the progression to lymphoma correlates with higher expression levels of LMP1 (Figure 1A and 1B), suggesting that LMP1 is directly involved in tumor development.
('LMP1', 'Gene_expression', 'LMP1')

Although many of the molecular properties studied were similar between wild-type and LMP1 transgenic lymphomas, there were distinguishing biological properties, namely the ability of LMP1 transgenic lymphomas to induce higher levels of survival and proliferation.
('LMP1', 'Gene_expression', 'LMP1')

Interestingly, although LMP1 transgenic mice develop lymphomas in the same B-1a cell type as spontaneous wild-type lymphomas (Figure 2), some signaling effects induced by LMP1 may explain the enhanced promotion to lymphomagenesis.
('LMP1', 'Gene_expression', 'LMP1')

In contrast, the preponderance of tumors of B-1a origin does not reflect effects of LMP1 signaling on B cell differentiation, as splenic B cells from healthy LMP1 transgenic mice contain similar numbers of B-1 and B-2 cells as wild-type mice.
('LMP1', 'Gene_expression', 'LMP1')

The lymphomas were marked by the upregulation of IL10, constitutive activation of Stat3 signaling, and a requirement for activation of Akt, NFkappaB, and Stat3 pathways (Figures 5 and 7).
('IL10', 'Positive_regulation', 'Stat3')

In addition, LMP1 has been shown to stimulate IL10 expression in Burkitt lymphoma cell lines [61,62].
('LMP1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL10')

This suggests that although Stat3 is constitutively activated in the lymphoma cells, the induction of IL10 may further enhance Stat3 activation or may contribute to other IL10-responsive signaling pathways.
('IL10', 'Positive_regulation', 'Stat3')

LMP1 activates both the canonical and non-canonical pathways of NFkappaB signaling [14,63-65], and inhibition of NFkappaB blocked the survival of LMP1 transgenic lymphocytes and LMP1-positive and -negative lymphoma cells.
('LMP1', 'Gene_expression', 'LMP1')

We have previously shown that cRel is specifically activated in both wild-type and LMP1 transgenic lymphomas, suggesting that activation of cRel is associated with B cell transformation [27].
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'cRel')

Our observations suggest that similar to CD40-induced proliferation, LMP1 induces proliferation through PI3K-mediated activation of Akt and activation of NFkappaB components such as cRel.
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'Akt'),('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'cRel')

CD40 also induces downregulation of the cell cycle inhibitor p27 through a PI3K-dependent manner, and the LMP1 lymphoma cells also had decreased levels of p27 with phosphorylation of Rb and increased Cdk2 (Figure 6C) [66].
('CD40', 'Negative_regulation', 'p27')

However, the activated pAkt did not lead to phosphorylation and inactivation of the downstream target GSK3 (Figure 6A).
('pAkt', 'Negative_regulation', 'GSK3'),('pAkt', 'Phosphorylation', 'GSK3')

In contrast, rapamycin, U0126, and SB202190 did not affect the survival of LMP1 transgenic lymphocytes or the wild-type and LMP1 transgenic lymphoma cells (Figure 7A, 7C, and 7E).
('LMP1', 'Gene_expression', 'LMP1')

Repression of the pro-apoptotic transcription factor FoxO1 in a PI3K-dependent manner can inhibit expression of bcl6, a transcription factor necessary for GC formation [49,70].
('FoxO1', 'Gene_expression', 'bcl6')

The constitutive signaling by LMP1 likely blocks GC formation through downregulation of bcl6.
('bcl6', 'Gene_expression', 'LMP1'),('LMP1', 'Gene_expression', 'bcl6')

Interestingly, clinical studies indicate that expression of LMP1 and bcl6 are mutually exclusive in non-HD and classical HD [72,73].
('bcl6', 'Gene_expression', 'LMP1'),('LMP1', 'Gene_expression', 'bcl6')

Although the activation of Akt and the lack of Fox01 in the lymphoma cells suggest that LMP1 affects bcl6 and GC formation through this pathway, regulation of other Forkhead targets involved in cell cycle progression, such as p27 and CyclinD2, likely contribute to malignant transformation.
('Akt', 'Negative_regulation', 'Fox01'),('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'Akt'),('bcl6', 'Gene_expression', 'LMP1'),('LMP1', 'Gene_expression', 'bcl6'),('Fox01', 'Regulation', 'bcl6')

Importantly, Akt, NFkappaB, and Stat3 pathways were critically required for the growth and survival of malignant lymphocytes as well as healthy LMP1 transgenic lymphocytes.
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'Akt')

It represses Runx1 and has a positive role in the induction of Eomes, granzyme B, perforin, and IFN-gamma.
('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin')

Additional experiments are needed to determine whether Eomes and Runx1 are also direct target genes of Runx3.
('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'Eomes')

Surprisingly, Runx3 contributed to the optimal expression of TNF, IL-2, and IFN-gamma at day 4 (Fig.
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'TNF')

For TNF and IL-2, the requirement for Runx3 subsides by day 6 (Fig.
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'TNF')

Runx3 continues to be required for IFN-gamma expression even at day 6, perhaps because of its role in the induction of Eomes expression (Fig.
('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'Eomes'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'IFN-gamma')

T-bet is needed early to confer on activated CD8+ T cells the competence to produce IFN-gamma upon restimulation, but its function is less important at later times.
('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma')

Eomes, which is induced late and functions downstream of Runx3, may substitute for T-bet in promoting the acute expression of IFN-gamma in restimulated CTLs (8).
('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'Eomes'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'IFN-gamma'),('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma')

Indeed, T-bet and Eomes both contribute to perforin expression in NK cells (8, 26), and Eomes induces granzyme B as effectively as T-bet in developing Th2 cells (7); thus, the relative roles of these T-box transcription factors vary depending on cell type.
('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'granzyme B')

Surprisingly, however, Eomes and T-bet appeared nonredundant in their ability to induce two other markers of CTL function, Prf1 and Gzmb (Fig.
('Eomes', 'Positive_regulation', 'Prf1'),('T-bet', 'Positive_regulation', 'Gzmb')

Rather, T-bet and Eomes were involved in regulating granzyme B and perforin expression, respectively: up-regulation of T-bet and Eomes mRNA and protein closely preceded up-regulation of Gzmb and Prf1 mRNA and protein, respectively.
('Eomes', 'Positive_regulation', 'Prf1'),('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'granzyme B'),('T-bet', 'Positive_regulation', 'Gzmb')

T-bet had no role in perforin expression under our culture conditions, and Eo-VP16 did not affect granzyme B expression when expressed in T-bet-/- or Runx3-/- cells.

Because conventional Eomes-deficient mice die before precursor cells can be isolated for bone marrow transfers (27) and because T cells conditionally deficient in Eomes have only recently been described (9), we were unable to introduce Runx3 into Eomes-deficient CD8+ T cells to test formally whether Eomes cooperated with Runx3 to induce perforin expression.

Collectively, our data are consistent with a transcriptional network in which preexisting Runx3 cooperates with the induced T-box factors T-bet and Eomes and IL-2Rbeta signals (unpublished data) to orchestrate CTL differentiation (Fig.
('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'Eomes'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2')

Our data recall the "feed-forward" interaction between T-bet and Runx3 that we previously described in CD4+ (Th1) T cells (15) but are distinct in two respects: in differentiating Th1 cells, T-bet is induced by TCR signals and IFN-gamma, and in turn induces Runx3 (15), whereas in differentiating CD8+ T cells, preexisting Runx3 is required to induce the T-box transcription factor Eomes.
('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'Eomes'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'IFN-gamma'),('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma')

The T-box transcription factors T-bet and Eomes have been linked to the regulation of genes encoding effector cytokines (e.g., Ifng) and genes important for cytolytic function (e.g., Prf1 and GzmB) (20).
('Eomes', 'Regulation', 'Prf1'),('Eomes', 'Regulation', 'Ifng'),('Eomes', 'Regulation', 'GzmB'),('T-bet', 'Regulation', 'GzmB'),('T-bet', 'Regulation', 'Prf1'),('T-bet', 'Regulation', 'Ifng')

T-bet mRNA expression slightly preceded the expression of GzmB mRNA; similarly, Eomes mRNA and protein were expressed ~1 d ahead of the reexpression of perforin mRNA and protein, respectively (Fig.
('Eomes', 'Regulation', 'GzmB'),('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('T-bet', 'Regulation', 'GzmB')

T-bet is required early for IFN-gamma production, and our data suggested that Eomes might not function during this early period but rather might contribute later to the control of perforin expression.
('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma')

Our data seemed most consistent with a model in which TCR signals induce T-bet, which in turn induces IFN-gamma (17) and possibly granzyme B; subsequently, Eomes is induced during the period of clonal expansion in IL-2 and activates perforin expression.
('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma')

A region that may also be important with respect to Foxp3 function is the leucine zipper domain, as demonstrated by the number of mutations associated with IPEX that have been mapped in this region of Foxp3.
('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'Foxp3')

Because the pathogenesis of a number of retroviral-induced immunologic disorders such as HIV-1/AIDS and HTLV-I/HAM/TSP have been associated with dysregulation of Foxp3 expression [8,45], we also examined the role of Foxp3 in retroviral gene expression.
('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'Foxp3')

In addition, the FKH domain of Foxp3 was required for this inhibitory effect in HEK 293T cells, but not in Jurkat T cells, similar to Foxp3-mediated suppression of a synthetic NF-kappaB reporter.
('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'Foxp3')

Foxp3 also affected two well-known functions of HTLV-I Tax: transactivation of the NF-kappaB pathway and, most surprisingly, transactivation of the HTLV-I LTR.
('Tax', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3')

Transactivation of the HTLV-I LTR by Tax involves the interaction of ATF/CREB factors with Tax in the nucleus.
('Tax', 'Binding', 'Tax')

Binding of Tax enhances ATF/CREB dimerization and promotes assembly of Tax-ATF/CREB complexes onto specific sequences in the viral promoter known as Tax-responsive elements.
('Tax', 'Binding', 'Tax')

Transactivation of the NF-kappaB pathway by Tax was inhibited by overexpression of full-length Foxp3, but not deltaFKH, as seen with basal activation of the HIV-1 LTR and a synthetic NF-kappaB reporter in HEK 293T cells.
('Tax', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3')

However, Tax-mediated transactivation of the HTLV-I LTR was inhibited by overexpression of both full-length Foxp3 as well as deltaFKH in both HEK 293T cells and CD4+ T cells.
('Tax', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3')

We demonstrated that Foxp3 did not directly affect the functioning of Tax, but rather Foxp3 targeted the transcription factors required for Tax transactivation (i.e., NF-kappaB and a then-unknown cellular factor, which we identified in this study as CREB).
('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'Foxp3'),('Tax', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3'),('Tax', 'Binding', 'Tax')

Importantly, we demonstrated that HTLV-I-infected individuals with the highest levels of Foxp3 protein expression within the CD4+CD25+ T cells population exhibited lower proviral loads than did individuals with the lowest levels of Foxp3 protein expression.
('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'Foxp3')

Therefore, Foxp3 becomes an attractive target for the development of novel therapeutic applications directed at modulating the expression of this important regulatory protein, especially in light of recent observations that the expression of Foxp3 can also be down-regulated by HTLV-I Tax [8].
('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'Foxp3'),('Tax', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3')

As the activation of the HTLV-I LTR depends primarily on ATF/CREB proteins (whether in the presence or the absence of Tax), we investigated whether Foxp3 could interact with this additional cellular signaling pathway.
('Tax', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3')

Our data demonstrate that Foxp3 interferes with the latter of these two processes and that the recruitment of the coactivator protein p300, and resulting transcriptional activation are blocked by Foxp3.
('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'p300'),('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'Foxp3')

This may be the result of the physical interaction we detected between Foxp3 and p300.
('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'p300')

With respect to HTLV-I LTR activity, while full-length Foxp3 inhibited both basal and Tax-dependent transcription by ~50%, deltaFKH appeared less effective in suppressing basal activation (~25% inhibition) compared to Tax-dependent activation (~50% inhibition).
('Tax', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3'),('Tax', 'Binding', 'Tax')

Future studies will be directed at identifying and characterizing cellular proteins that interact with Foxp3 both in the nucleus and cytoplasm, in order to better address how Foxp3 functions to guide the development and function of regulatory T cells in health and disease.
('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'Foxp3')

CD40-mediated phosphorylation and degradation of IkappaBalpha in HOIP-deficient cells was dramatically impaired relative to that observed in parental A20.2J cells (Fig.
('CD40', 'Protein_catabolism', 'IkappaBalpha'),('CD40', 'Phosphorylation', 'IkappaBalpha')

In vitro human CD4+ and CD8+ T cell clones, or mouse CD4+ T cells that produce both interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and IL-10, can be differentiated by T cell receptor (TCR)-stimulation in the presence of IL-12 (Chang et al., 2007; Gerosa et al., 1996; Jeannin et al., 1996; Meyaard et al., 1996; Windhagen et al., 1996).
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma')

Th1 cell development requires signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)1 activation, induced by type I IFN or IFN-gamma, the transcription factor T-box 21 (T-bet), and IL-12-induced STAT4 signaling, which can couple with IL-18-induced IRAK and NF-kappaB transcription factors to drive the high amounts of IFN-gamma required to eradicate intracellular pathogens (Glimcher and Murphy, 2000).
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('IFN-gamma', 'Positive_regulation', 'signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)1'),('signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)1', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('type I IFN', 'Positive_regulation', 'signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)1')

The development of Th17 cells requires IL-6, TGF-beta, and the STAT3-dependent expression of the transcription factor RORgammat (Ivanov et al., 2007; Stockinger and Veldhoen, 2007).
('STAT3', 'Gene_expression', 'RORgammat')

Whereas high doses of antigen, with sustained TCR signaling and extracellular-signal regulated (ERK) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation, result in Th1 cells producing IFN-gamma via an IL-12-independent mechanism, low doses of antigen, with transient ERK1 and ERK2 activation, favor Th2 responses and IL-4 secretion (Constant et al., 1995; Hosken et al., 1995; Jorritsma et al., 2003; Yamane et al., 2005).
('ERK2', 'Localization', 'IL-4'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('ERK1', 'Localization', 'IL-4')

Here, we showed that in vitro differentiation of IL-10-producing Th1 cells from naive CD4+ T cells required IL-12-induced STAT4 signaling, strong TCR activation (high antigen dose), and sustained ERK1 and ERK2 phosphorylation.
('ERK1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('ERK2', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Furthermore, we showed that activation of ERK1 and ERK2 is a requirement for production of IL-10 by Th1, Th2, and Th17 cell subsets.
('ERK1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('ERK2', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Runx3 and perforin mRNA are expressed by double-positive (DP) thymocytes and CD8+single-positive (SP) thymocytes but not in CD4+SP cells (14).
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin')

T-bet is induced quickly upon TCR stimulation and is required for early programming of cytokine production (17), whereas Eomes is induced later during differentiation and sustains IFN-gamma expression.
('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma')

Runx3 is required for Eomes and perforin expression, and both Eomes and Runx3 bind at thePrf1locus; in contrast, perforin expression is unaffected in T-bet-deficient cells.
('Eomes', 'Transcription', 'Prf1'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'Eomes'),('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin')

T cells lacking Runx3 show decreased expression of IFN-gamma and granzyme B, and Runx3 also binds the promoter regions of theIfngandGzmbgenes.
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'granzyme B'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'Gzmb')

Collectively, these results provide evidence for a complex transcriptional network in which Runx3 is a primary regulator ofGzmbexpression but synergizes with T-bet and Eomes, respectively, to promote transcription of theIfngandPrf1genes.
('T-bet', 'Transcription', 'Ifng'),('Eomes', 'Transcription', 'Prf1'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'Eomes'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'Gzmb')

Material immunoprecipitated with an isotype control antibody (isotype) or anti-CD40 antibody was examined by Western blotting for CD40, TRAF2, TRAF3, cIAP1, HOIP, IKKalpha/beta, and IKKgamma (right panels).
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'IKKgamma')

(C) To further evaluate HOIP-dependent recruitment of IKKgamma to CD40, A20.2J cells or HOIP-deficient (HOIP-/-) A20.2J cells were transduced with an empty retroviral vector or a retroviral construct encoding BP epitope-tagged IKKgamma (noted in the figure as pMIP and IKKgamma, respectively).
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'IKKgamma')

CD40-mediated CD80 upregulation is defective in HOIP-deficient cells.
('CD40', 'Positive_regulation', 'CD80')

Cells were incubated for 72 hrs with an isotype control antibody (left) or anti-CD40 antibody (right) and then stained for expression of CD80 (filled profiles indicate staining with anti-CD80 antibody; open profiles are staining with an isotype control antibody).
('CD40', 'Positive_regulation', 'CD80')

HOIP is required for CD40-mediated CD80 upregulation and activation of germline epsilon transcription
('CD40', 'Gene_expression', 'CD80'),('HOIP', 'Positive_regulation', 'CD80'),('CD40', 'Positive_regulation', 'CD80')

Engagement of CD40 on B cells upregulates expression of CD80 [10], a cell surface protein that promotes activation of T cells interacting with B cells and other APC.
('CD40', 'Gene_expression', 'CD80'),('CD40', 'Positive_regulation', 'CD80')

To begin evaluating potential contributions of HOIP to CD40 signaling, we assayed the upregulation of CD80 induced by engagement of CD40 on parental A20.2J, HOIP-deficient, and HOIP-reconstituted cells (Fig.
('CD40', 'Gene_expression', 'CD80'),('HOIP', 'Positive_regulation', 'CD80'),('CD40', 'Positive_regulation', 'CD80')

Compared to the parental cell line, the CD40-stimulated upregulation of CD80 was dramatically reduced in all HOIP-deficient cells tested.
('CD40', 'Gene_expression', 'CD80'),('HOIP', 'Positive_regulation', 'CD80'),('CD40', 'Positive_regulation', 'CD80')

In contrast, upregulation of CD80 was restored in HOIP-reconstituted cells, confirming that the defect in CD80 upregulation in the HOIP-deficient cells was due to the disruption of Rnf31.
('HOIP', 'Positive_regulation', 'CD80')

Perforin and granzyme B expression are not appreciably regulated by T-bet
('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'granzyme B'),('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'Perforin')

To test the model outlined in the previous paragraph directly, we compared the expression of IFN-gamma, perforin, and granzyme B in CD8+ T cells from WT and Tbx21 (T-bet)-deficient mice.
('T-bet', 'Transcription', 'perforin'),('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'granzyme B'),('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma')

In contrast, T-bet-deficient T cells cultured for 6 d showed no defect in perforin mRNA expression (Fig.
('T-bet', 'Transcription', 'perforin')

We consistently observed a modest reduction in GzmB mRNA in T-bet-deficient T cells (Fig.
('T-bet', 'Transcription', 'GzmB'),('T-bet', 'Negative_regulation', 'GzmB')

Eo-VP16, but not the empty GFP retrovirus, increased perforin expression in both WT and T-bet-deficient CD8+ T cells (Fig.
('T-bet', 'Transcription', 'perforin'),('Eo-VP16', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin')

As expected, Eo-VP16 also rescued the early defect in IFN-gamma production observed in T-bet-deficient CD8+ T cells (Fig.
('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma')

However, Eo-VP16 did not induce GzmB mRNA expression in either WT or T-bet-deficient cells; thus, the partial T-bet dependence of GzmB mRNA expression cannot be compensated for by Eo-VP16.

Runx3 controls multiple aspects of the CTL differentiation program, in part through induction of Eomes
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'Eomes'),('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'Eomes')

Strikingly, Runx3-/- CD8+ T cells were strongly impaired in their ability to differentiate into effector CTLs, as judged by expression of perforin, granzyme B, and IFN-gamma (Fig.
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'granzyme B'),('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'granzyme B'),('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'perforin')

Compared with WT T cells, perforin mRNA and protein expression were essentially undetectable in Runx3-/- T cells at day 6 of culture (Fig.
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'perforin')

Runx3-/- T cells also had no detectable Eomes expression; in contrast, T-bet expression was unimpaired (Fig.
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'Eomes'),('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'Eomes')

Furthermore, Runx3 was required for maximal production of IFN-gamma, but not TNF or IL-2, by CD8+ T cells restimulated at day 6 (Fig.
('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'TNF')

We previously reported that Th1 cell differentiation was regulated through a feed-forward loop in which T-bet is up-regulated early and induces Runx3, after which T-bet and Runx3 cooperate to induce IFN-gamma and silence IL-4, thus promoting stable differentiation toward the Th1 lineage (15, 22).
('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma')

Because (a) Runx3 appeared necessary for Eomes induction (Fig.
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'Eomes'),('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'Eomes')

3 A), (b) the kinetics of Eomes expression paralleled those of perforin expression (Fig.
('Eomes', 'Transcription', 'perforin'),('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin')

2), and (c) overexpression of Eo-VP16 in either WT or T-bet-deficient T cells led to an increase in both perforin and IFN-gamma expression (Fig.
('Eo-VP16', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin')

Specifically, we asked whether Runx3, which was necessary for Eomes induction, then cooperated with Eomes to regulate transcription of the effector CTL markers perforin, IFN-gamma, and granzyme B.
('Eomes', 'Transcription', 'IFN-gamma'),('Eomes', 'Transcription', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'granzyme B'),('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'Eomes'),('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'Eomes'),('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'granzyme B'),('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'granzyme B'),('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'perforin'),('Eomes', 'Transcription', 'granzyme B')

To test this hypothesis, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays to ask whether Eomes and Runx3 bound regulatory regions of the Prf1, Ifng, and Gzmb genes (Fig.
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'Eomes'),('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'Eomes')

Runx3 bound to the Prf1 and Gzmb transcription start sites (TSS); to a known IL-2 responsive enhancer located near -1 kb of the Prf1 gene (23); to the distal CTL-specific DNase I hypersensitive site 9 in the Prf1 locus (24); to the Ifng promoter near the TSS, as previously reported for Th1 cells (10); and to several DNase I hypersensitive sites in the Ifng locus (Fig.
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2')

To determine whether Runx3 controlled the expression of CTL effector genes through its induction of Eomes, we retrovirally expressed Runx3 and Eo-VP16 in CD8+ T cells from Runx3-/- mice.
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'Eomes'),('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'Eomes')

Reconstitution of Runx3-/- CD8+ T cells with Runx3 restored expression of Eomes as well as perforin, granzyme B, and IFN-gamma (Fig.
('Eomes', 'Transcription', 'IFN-gamma'),('Eomes', 'Transcription', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'granzyme B'),('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'Eomes'),('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'Eomes'),('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'granzyme B'),('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'granzyme B'),('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'perforin'),('Eomes', 'Transcription', 'granzyme B')

Notably, Eo-VP16 did not up-regulate perforin expression when expressed in Runx3-/- cells, even though it restored the capacity to induce IFN-gamma expression upon TCR restimulation (Fig.
('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'IFN-gamma'),('Eo-VP16', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'perforin')

This result suggests strongly that perforin expression requires Runx3 and Eomes.
('Eomes', 'Transcription', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'Eomes'),('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'Eomes'),('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'perforin')

As expected from their defect in perforin and granzyme B expression, Runx3-/- CD8+ T cells showed defective cytolytic activity in a mixed lymphocyte reaction (12).
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'granzyme B'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'granzyme B'),('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'perforin')

Therefore, although activation of the perforin/granzyme B machinery is defective in Runx3-/- CD8+ cells, these cells are not entirely devoid of cytolytic activity and could still effectively kill targets, possibly by alternative mechanisms such as the Fas-Fas ligand pathway.

IL-12 and High Doses of Antigen Induce the Development of Th1 Cells Producing IL-10
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Culture of naive CD4+ T cells in an APC-free system by stimulation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies in the presence of IL-12 resulted in IFN-gamma-producing Th1 cells, a proportion of which coproduced IL-10, as did Th2 cells resulting from culture in IL-4 (Figure S1B).
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma')

To investigate whether the lack of IL-10 produced by Th1 cells resulted from inhibition of IL-10 production by DCs and high antigen dose or alternatively required IL-12, we cultured naive CD4+ T cells with increasing doses of antigen presented by DC in the presence of IL-12.
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

At low doses of antigen, IL-12 abrogated the development of Th2 cells and induced IFN-gamma expression but only low levels of IL-10 expression, suggesting that IL-12 per se was not sufficient to induce significant IL-10 production in Th1 cells (Figure 1A).
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma')

Strikingly, as the antigen dose was increased, Th1 populations driven with IL-12 now contained higher numbers of IL-10-producing cells (Figure 1A) and produced more IL-10 protein upon restimulation (Figures 1A and 1B).
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Thus, the development of Th1 cells producing IL-10 required both IL-12 and high doses of antigen.
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Th1 cells differentiated to produce large amounts of IL-10 and IFN-gamma and lost their capacity to produce IL-2 (Figure 1B).
('IL-2', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Because the presence of IL-12 reduced the proliferation of CD4+ T cells at both high and low antigen doses (Table S1), and only the former showed IL-10 production, the development of high IL-10-producing cells is most likely not related to limited IL-2.
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-2', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Naive CD4+ T cells from DO11.10/recombination-activating gene 1 (Rag1)-deficient animals, cultured with high doses of antigen in the presence of IL-12, also resulted in IL-10 expression by Th1 cells, showing that this expression was not dependent on the presence of effector or memory T cells or Treg cells (Figure S2).
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Although it has been suggested that TGF-beta can induce IL-10 in CD4+ T cells (Kitani et al., 2003; Schiott et al., 2000), we found that in developing Th1 and Th2 cells this was not the case (data not shown).
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

In fact, neutralization of TGF-beta led to increased IL-10 production by both T cell subsets (Figure S3).
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Thus, the development of IL-10-producing Th1 cells only depended on the presence of IL-12 together with high antigen dose and not on other soluble factors such as IL-2 or TGF-beta or on the presence of other T cell types.
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-2', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

A low amount of transcription of Ifngamma was induced by IL-12 when cells were differentiated with low antigen dose, but this effect of IL-12 was markedly upregulated with increasing doses of antigen (Figure 6A).
('IL-12', 'Transcription', 'Ifngamma'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'Ifngamma')

However, IL-12 induced a high amount of Il10 transcription as well as Ifngamma expression with increased antigen doses (Figure 6A), again in keeping with the protein data (Figure 1A).
('IL-12', 'Transcription', 'Ifngamma'),('IL-12', 'Transcription', 'Il10'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'Ifngamma')

In contrast, high amounts of GATA-3 mRNA expression were only observed under Th2 cell differentiation conditions (low-dose antigen) (Figure 6B), and this expression was markedly downregulated by both increasing antigen dose and coculture in IL-12 (Figure 6B).
('IL-12', 'Transcription', 'GATA-3')

Interestingly, IL-12 sustained the high expression of c-Maf mRNA even at the highest antigen dose (Figure 6B).
('IL-12', 'Transcription', 'c-Maf')

Moreover, IL-12 maintenance of c-maf expression required STAT4 activation (data not shown).
('c-maf', 'Positive_regulation', 'STAT4'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'c-maf')

We showed also that like Il10 expression, c-maf expression was inhibited in Th1 and Th17 cells in the presence of the MEK1 and MEK2 inhibitor (PD184352), whereas T-bet and RORgammat expression was hardly affected (Figure 6D).
('MEK2', 'Gene_expression', 'c-maf'),('MEK2', 'Gene_expression', 'RORgammat'),('MEK1', 'Gene_expression', 'RORgammat'),('MEK1', 'Gene_expression', 'T-bet'),('MEK1', 'Gene_expression', 'c-maf'),('MEK1', 'Gene_expression', 'Il10'),('MEK2', 'Gene_expression', 'Il10'),('MEK2', 'Gene_expression', 'T-bet')

To define the requirements of Foxp3 with respect to inhibition of NF-kappaB-dependent transcription, we utilized a mutant of Foxp3 lacking the FKH domain (Figure 2A) [16], similar to the scurfy mutant Foxp3 of mice, and a mutant Foxp3 protein from a patient with IPEX [4,11,14,17].
('Foxp3', 'Localization', 'Foxp3')

Although Foxp3 interaction with NF-kappaB presumably takes place in the nucleus, it may also be possible for a cytoplasmic Foxp3 protein to bind to NF-kappaB in the cytoplasm and prevent localization to the nucleus following an activation stimulus.
('Foxp3', 'Localization', 'Foxp3')

Western blot analysis of NF-kappaB p65 expression demonstrated that Foxp3 and deltaFKH does not block NF-kappaB activation at the level of p65 protein expression (Figure 2E).
('deltaFKH', 'Gene_expression', 'p65'),('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'p65')

These results are very interesting with respect to Foxp3 function, because they suggest that the carboxyl-terminal FKH domain, and possibly nuclear localization, are dispensable for Foxp3 function in T cell populations.
('Foxp3', 'Localization', 'Foxp3')

We observed no genetic alterations in the IRF-4 promoter, which can account for the lack of IRF-4 expression: The detected base pair changes at position -1081 (T to C substitution), at position -1068 (A to C substitution) and at position -116 (A to C substitution) are unlikely responsible for absent IRF-4-expression since the first two mutations were found both in IRF-4-positive and -negative cells whereas the latter change was not detected consistently in all IRF-4-negative or -positive cells and may thus be a polymorphism.
('IRF-4', 'Binding', 'IRF-4'),('IRF-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'IRF-4')

Since IRF-4 expression in cell lines and CML can be induced by demethylation and successful IFN-alpha therapy (3), respectively, the existence of such genetic aberrations seems unlikely.
('IFN-alpha', 'Gene_expression', 'IRF-4')

We then investigated whether the previously described down-regulation of IRF-4 expression in human myeloid leukemias was due to a differential hypermethylation of the promoter, since the presented re-expression due to AzadC-treatment might also be a result of activation of positive transcriptional regulators of IRF-4.
('IRF-4', 'Binding', 'IRF-4'),('IRF-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'IRF-4')

We found that IRF-4 expression could indeed be connected to the methylation status of distinct CpG motifs in the IRF-4 promoter.
('IRF-4', 'Binding', 'IRF-4'),('IRF-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'IRF-4')

At two further CpG sites (#48, 45) the methylation status in IRF-4-positive was lower than that of IRF-4-negative cells.
('IRF-4', 'Binding', 'IRF-4'),('IRF-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'IRF-4')

It has been shown that NFkappaB elements play an important role in IRF-4 induction as IRF-4 expression depends on binding of the transactivator c-Rel to these elements in the IRF-4 promoter (31,37).
('c-Rel', 'Gene_expression', 'IRF-4'),('IRF-4', 'Binding', 'IRF-4'),('IRF-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'IRF-4')

Via in vitro methylation and reporter gene assays we could clearly appoint the silencing of the IRF-4 promoter to a methylation effect, which may thus be the mechanism of IRF-4 deregulation in vivo.
('IRF-4', 'Binding', 'IRF-4'),('IRF-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'IRF-4')

The finding that IRF-4 expression is silenced by promoter hypermethylation might represent a mechanism that accounts for the previously observed loss of IRF-4 expression in CML.
('IRF-4', 'Binding', 'IRF-4'),('IRF-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'IRF-4')

Still, the obvious functional diversity of IRF-4 remains remarkable and cannot be fully explained by the IRF-4 promoter methylation status.
('IRF-4', 'Binding', 'IRF-4'),('IRF-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'IRF-4')

In multiple myeloma (MM) a translocation on chromosome 14q was reported to lead to a fusion gene of immunoglobulin heavy-chain (IgH) and IRF-4 resulting in a subsequent overexpression of IRF-4 (48,49).
('IRF-4', 'Binding', 'IRF-4'),('IRF-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'IRF-4')

Down-regulation of IRF-4 may promote leukemogenesis in myeloid cell context (3), which was recently confirmed in IRF-4-/- ICSBP-/- double knock-out mice (53), while IRF-4 up-regulation may induce a growth advantage in lymphomas or MM (48).
('IRF-4', 'Binding', 'IRF-4'),('IRF-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'IRF-4')

Taken together, our data suggest that IRF-4 promoter methylation regulates IRF-4 expression, and that aberrant expression of IRF-4 in certain types of leukemia may be a consequence of IRF-4 promoter hypermethylation.
('IRF-4', 'Binding', 'IRF-4'),('IRF-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'IRF-4')

We previously showed that the TRAF family member TRAF2 mediates recruitment of HOIL-1L-interacting protein (HOIP) to the cytoplasmic domain of CD40, suggesting that HOIP has a role in the CD40 signaling pathway.
('TRAF2', 'Binding', 'HOIL-1L-interacting protein')

We found that the CD40-induced upregulation of CD80 and activation of germline immunoglobulin epsilon transcription were defective in HOIP-deficient cells.
('CD40', 'Positive_regulation', 'CD80')

Runx3-deficient T cells fail to silence CD4 expression normally (Fig.
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'CD4')

We therefore further fractionated the positively selected CD8+ T cells from Runx3 KO mice into CD8+CD4- SP or CD8+CD4+ DP cells by separation using anti-CD4 magnetic beads.
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'CD4')

This yielded a Runx3 KO SP "enriched" population that contained 75% CD8+CD4- cells and a KO DP enriched population that contained 85% CD8+CD4+ cells (Fig.
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'CD4')

As previously reported, TCR-induced proliferation of Runx3-/- CD8+ T cells was severely impaired, irrespective of CD4 expression (Fig.
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'CD4')

Although a fraction of the KO DP cells silenced CD4 expression after activation, the ratio of SP/DP cells in each enriched population remained constant thereafter, and we did not observe any major differences between these two populations throughout the culture period, indicating that in terms of effector CTL differentiation and under our culture conditions, Runx3-/- CD8+ T cells that also coexpress CD4 are indistinguishable from those that do not.
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'CD4')

Although Foxp3 could down-regulate Tax-dependent transactivation of the HTLV-I LTR (Figure 4B) and inhibit Tax expression from an infectious molecular clone (Figure 5), Foxp3 failed to modulate Tax function in the absence of the viral promoter (Figure 4D).
('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

Therefore, we hypothesized that Foxp3 may inhibit Tax transactivation of the HTLV-I LTR via disruption of the CREB signaling pathway.
('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

To test this possibility, HEK 293T cells were transfected with an HTLV-I LTR or synthetic CREB reporter vector along with a control expression vector (EGFP) or expression vectors encoding Foxp3 or deltaFKH.
('deltaFKH', 'Positive_regulation', 'CREB')

Like NF-kappaB activation, CREB transcriptional activation was also suppressed by expression of Foxp3, and to a similar extent deltaFKH, in healthy donor CD4+ T cells (Figure 6B).
('deltaFKH', 'Positive_regulation', 'CREB')

As observed with NF-kappaB activation, deltaFKH was a more potent inhibitor of CREB activation in CD4+ T cells than in HEK 293T cells, further indicating that a cell type-specific mechanism of action may govern the function of this Foxp3 mutant.
('deltaFKH', 'Positive_regulation', 'CREB')

However, Foxp3 failed to markedly affect transcriptional activation of Gal4-BD-c-Jun (c-Jun has also been demonstrated to bind to the HTLV-I LTR) and Gal4-BD-Tax (see Figure 5).
('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

We recently demonstrated that HOIL-1L interacting protein (HOIP), a ubiquitin ligase that can catalyze the assembly of linear polyubiquitin chains [5], is recruited to CD40 in a TRAF2-dependent manner following engagement of CD40 by agonistic antibody [6].
('TRAF2', 'Binding', 'HOIL-1L interacting protein')

We found that the CD40-induced upregulation of CD80 (a costimulatory molecule for T cells) was defective in HOIP-deficient cells.
('CD40', 'Positive_regulation', 'CD80')

The Transactivation Functions of HTLV-I Tax Are Suppressed by Foxp3
('Foxp3', 'Transcription', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

Since the HTLV-I Tax protein can function at multiple levels in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus to stimulate activation of NF-kappaB [28,29], we hypothesized that overexpression of Foxp3 may interfere with this process.
('Foxp3', 'Transcription', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

However, since Tax-dependent HTLV-I gene expression is independent of NF-kappaB [18], we also hypothesized that Foxp3 would not affect Tax-dependent activation of the HTLV-I LTR.
('Foxp3', 'Transcription', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

To test these hypotheses, we overexpressed HTLV-I Tax, full-length Foxp3, and/or deltaFKH in HEK 293T cells cotransfected with an HTLV-I LTR or NF-kappaB reporter vector.
('deltaFKH', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Transcription', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

Interestingly, overexpression of Foxp3, but not deltaFKH, suppressed Tax-mediated activation of NF-kappaB-dependent transcription.
('deltaFKH', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Transcription', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

These observations further suggest that the carboxyl-terminal FKH domain is required for inhibiting activation of NF-kappaB in the presence of Tax in HEK 293T cells, strikingly similar to the requirements of Foxp3 inhibition of basal NF-kappaB activation shown in Figure 2B.
('Foxp3', 'Transcription', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

Transactivation of the HTLV-I LTR was stimulated about 55-fold by overexpression of Tax (Figure 4B), while transfection of Foxp3 suppressed Tax-dependent HTLV-I LTR activation, although HTLV-I LTR activation in the presence or absence of Tax is independent of NF-kappaB or NF-AT (another transcriptional activator known to interact with Foxp3).
('Foxp3', 'Transcription', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

Furthermore, overexpression of deltaFKH also led to suppression of HTLV-I transactivation by Tax to a similar extent as full-length Foxp3 (Figure 4B).
('deltaFKH', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Transcription', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

The suppressive effects shown in Figure 4A and 4B were not the result of Foxp3 down-regulating the expression of the transfected Tax plasmid as determined by real-time RT-PCR (Figure 4C).
('Foxp3', 'Transcription', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

These results strongly suggest that Foxp3 interacts with transcriptional regulators in addition to NF-kappaB and NF-AT, and that the carboxyl-terminal FKH domain, and therefore localization to the nucleus, are not required for inhibition of Tax-mediated HTLV-I LTR activation (even in HEK 293T cells).
('Foxp3', 'Transcription', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

To determine whether Foxp3 inhibited the transactivation functions of Tax by directly associating with this viral protein, we generated an expression vector in which HTLV-I Tax was fused in-frame to the carboxyl terminus of the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (Gal4-BD).
('Foxp3', 'Transcription', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

Transactivation of the Gal4-resposive promoter by Gal4-BD-Tax remained relatively unaffected by overexpression of either EGFP (control), Foxp3, or deltaFKH, suggesting that Foxp3 does not repress Tax transactivation by directly interfacing with the HTLV-I Tax protein.
('deltaFKH', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Transcription', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

As illustrated in Figure 5, the level of Tax mRNA synthesized from ACH was down-regulated in the presence of Foxp3 compared to the level produced in the presence of the control vector.
('Foxp3', 'Transcription', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

deltaFKH did not have a discernable affect on Tax expression.
('deltaFKH', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

These data indicate that Foxp3 is capable of repressing the expression of Tax from an infectious HTLV-I molecular clone.
('Foxp3', 'Transcription', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

HOIP is necessary for association of the IKK complex with CD40
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40')

The marked defects in CD40-mediated cell activation and signaling displayed by HOIP-deficient cells suggested that HOIP mediates recruitment of critical components of the CD40 signaling apparatus to the receptor.
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40')

Previously, we demonstrated that HOIP is recruited to the CD40 signaling complex in a TRAF2-dependent manner, suggesting that HOIP functions downstream of TRAF2 [6].
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40'),('HOIP', 'Binding', 'TRAF2'),('TRAF2', 'Binding', 'HOIP')

Studies by others suggest that the TRAF2-associated proteins cIAP1 and cIAP2 play a role in the recruitment of HOIP to TNFR1 and CD40 [14].
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'cIAP1'),('cIAP2', 'Binding', 'HOIP'),('cIAP1', 'Binding', 'HOIP'),('cIAP', 'Binding', 'HOIP'),('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40'),('HOIP', 'Binding', 'TRAF2'),('TRAF2', 'Binding', 'HOIP'),('cIAP', 'Protein_modification', 'HOIP')

Therefore, we determined whether the association of HOIP with CD40 in A20.2J cells was altered by treatment of cells with an inhibitor of cIAP activity, a membrane-permeable peptide derived from the apoptosis regulator SMAC [15].
('cIAP', 'Binding', 'HOIP'),('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40'),('cIAP', 'Protein_modification', 'HOIP')

SMAC peptide treatment also resulted in a slight but reproducible decrease in the amount of the major HOIP form recovered by CD40 immunoprecipitation, along with an apparent increase in higher molecular weight species recognized by anti-HOIP antibody.
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40')

These data suggest that SMAC peptide treatment specifically alters the characteristics of CD40-associated HOIP rather than the entire cellular pool of this protein.
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40')

Together, these results support the idea that the cIAP proteins influence the recruitment and post-translational modification state of CD40-associated HOIP.
('cIAP', 'Binding', 'HOIP'),('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40'),('cIAP', 'Protein_modification', 'HOIP')

To test the possibility that HOIP is responsible for the recruitment of other critical signaling proteins to CD40, we immunoprecipitated CD40 signaling complexes from HOIP-deficient and HOIP-reconstituted cells (Fig.
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40')

As described previously, CD40 signaling complexes immunoprecipitated from A20.2J cells contained HOIP as well as TRAF2, TRAF3, IKKalpha/beta, and IKKgamma [6].
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'TRAF3'),('HOIP', 'Binding', 'IKKgamma'),('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40'),('HOIP', 'Binding', 'TRAF2'),('TRAF2', 'Binding', 'HOIP')

The amounts of TRAF2, TRAF3, and cIAP1 in CD40 immunoprecipitates from HOIP-deficient cells were similar to those from parental A20.2J cells, indicating that HOIP is not required for the association of these proteins with CD40.
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'cIAP1'),('HOIP', 'Binding', 'TRAF3'),('cIAP1', 'Binding', 'HOIP'),('cIAP', 'Binding', 'HOIP'),('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40'),('HOIP', 'Binding', 'TRAF2'),('TRAF2', 'Binding', 'HOIP'),('cIAP', 'Protein_modification', 'HOIP')

In contrast, IKKalpha/beta and IKKgamma were not detectable in CD40 immunoprecipitates recovered from HOIP-deficient cells (Fig.
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'IKKgamma'),('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40')

The amounts of IKKalpha/beta and IKKgamma in CD40 immunoprecipitates from HOIP-reconstituted cells were similar to those detected in samples prepared from parental cells, demonstrating that the defects in IKK recruitment we observed were due specifically to the absence of HOIP expression.
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'IKKgamma'),('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40')

These data indicate that HOIP is required for recruitment of the NF-kappaB-activating complex to the CD40 signaling complex.
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40')

To confirm that this higher molecular weight species was indeed IKKgamma, we generated A20.2J cell lines containing a stably integrated retroviral vector that encoded an epitope-tagged version of mouse IKKgamma.
('IKKgamma', 'Protein_modification', 'IKKgamma')

Moreover, analysis of cells expressing epitope tagged-IKKgamma confirmed that recruitment of IKKgamma to CD40 requires HOIP.
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'IKKgamma'),('IKKgamma', 'Protein_modification', 'IKKgamma'),('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40')

Overall, these data demonstrate that HOIP is required for the association of IKKgamma with CD40, and suggest that this event is coupled to post-translational modifications of IKKgamma.
