It also abolished IL-4-induced upregulation of CD40 but promoted upregulation of CD23.
('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'CD23')

A human IL-5 promoter/enhancer luciferase gene construct transfected into IL-5-producing T cell clones was clearly transcribed after stimulation, indicating that the 515 base pair IL-5 gene segment upstream of the coding region was sufficient to respond to activating signals in human helper T cells.
('IL-5', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-5')

The same gene segment was not transcribed in IL-5-nonproducing T cell clones, suggesting that human T cell IL-5 synthesis is regulated at the transcriptional level.

We demonstrate that IKKbeta-mediated RPS3 S209 phosphorylation represents a critical determinant in governing its nuclear import thus unveiling a novel mechanism behind NF-kappaB regulatory specificity.
('IKKbeta', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3')

The recent observation that human IKKbeta displayed CK2-like phosphorylation specificity29 coincides with our evidence that recombinant IKKbeta, but not IKKalpha, phosphorylated RPS3.
('IKKbeta', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3')

CK2 was previously shown to phosphorylate p65 and to bind to and phosphorylate IKKbeta41-43, however, we ruled out the possibility that the IKKbeta-bound CK2 could account for the observed RPS3 phosphorylation because no CK2 was detected in the IKKbeta preparations used for the in vitro kinase assay.
('IKKbeta', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3')

Because RPS3 only harbors the CK2 motif and not a traditional IKK motif, this RPS3 regulatory function could explain why IKK harbors the alternative substrate phosphorylation capability.
('RPS3', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

IKKbeta-mediated RPS3 S209 phosphorylation is a critical target modulated by this pathogen to subvert host NF-kappaB signaling.
('IKKbeta', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3')

The bacterial effector NleH1 specifically binds to RPS3 once injected into host cells and profoundly suppresses NF-kappaB and its attendant protective immune responses9.
('NleH1', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3')

Our data now show that NleH1 selectively inhibits RPS3 phosphorylation, thus retarding its nuclear translocation and subsequent NF-kappaB function, without altering other NF-kappaB signaling.
('NleH1', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3')

Although NleH1 did not directly phosphorylate IKKbeta, its kinase activity was required to inhibit IKKbeta-mediated RPS3 S209 phosphorylation.
('NleH1', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('IKKbeta', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3')

NleH1 attenuates the transcription of RPS3-dependent, but not all, NF-kappaB target genes, in particular those genes associated with acute proinflammatory responses, including IL8 and TNF.
('NleH1', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3')

In contrast, NleH1 does not block NF-kappaB p65 nuclear translocation, which suggests that certain p65-dependent but RPS3-independent NF-kappaB target genes might thus be beneficial for E. coli O157:H7 to replicate and disseminate in the host.
('NleH1', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('NleH1', 'Localization', 'p65')

By selectively inhibiting RPS3 and its attendant NF-kappaB function with NleH1, the pathogen achieves the ability to increase colonization and diarrhea yet limiting the mortality of the host.
('NleH1', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3')

EBNA-2 trans-activates cellular and viral genes like CD23, c-fgr, latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) and terminal protein 1 (TP1).
('EBNA-2', 'Positive_regulation', 'LMP'),('EBNA-2', 'Gene_expression', 'LMP')

EBNA-2 is able to trans-activate the expression of the LMP gene in several cell lines.
('EBNA-2', 'Positive_regulation', 'LMP'),('EBNA-2', 'Gene_expression', 'LMP')

Various reports have delineated the cis-acting elements of the LMP promoter through which EBNA-2 mediates trans-activation.
('EBNA-2', 'Positive_regulation', 'LMP'),('EBNA-2', 'Gene_expression', 'LMP')

To determine whether EBNA-2 also trans-activates the LMP promoter by protein-protein interactions, we performed a series of gel retardation assays and competition experiments with LMP promoter fragments of different sizes.
('EBNA-2', 'Positive_regulation', 'LMP'),('EBNA-2', 'Gene_expression', 'LMP')

However, analysis of sucrose gradient fractions in the gel retardation assay provided evidence that the LMP promoter-binding proteins form a complex of higher M(r) in EBNA-2-positive cell extracts.
('EBNA-2', 'Positive_regulation', 'LMP'),('EBNA-2', 'Gene_expression', 'LMP')

We deduce from these results that EBNA-2-positive cells might indeed contain specific complexes bound to the LMP promoter which are, however, too labile to be detected in a standard gel retardation assay.

BMP-6 inhibits growth of mature human B cells; induction of Smad phosphorylation and upregulation of Id1
('Smad', 'Positive_regulation', 'Id1')

The B cells were found to express BMP type I and type II receptors and BMP-6 rapidly induced phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8.
('BMP-6', 'Phosphorylation', '8'),('BMP-6', 'Phosphorylation', 'Smad1'),('BMP-6', 'Phosphorylation', '5')

Furthermore, Smad-phosphorylation was followed by upregulation of Id1 mRNA and Id1 protein, whereas Id2 and Id3 expression was not affected.
('Smad', 'Gene_expression', 'Id3'),('Smad', 'Positive_regulation', 'Id1'),('Smad', 'Gene_expression', 'Id2')

In mature human B cells, BMP-6 inhibited cell growth, and rapidly induced phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8 followed by an upregulation of Id1.

Activation of the erythropoietin receptor caused specific DNA-binding of Stat 5b, but failed to induce reporter gene transcription.
('erythropoietin receptor', 'Binding', 'Stat 5b')

The current study clearly demonstrates that IL-2 does not induce I kappa B alpha degradation or NF-kappa B activation in primary human T cells that respond to IL-2 by entering the cell cycle and avoiding apoptosis.
('IL-2', 'Protein_catabolism', 'I kappa B alpha')

However, this deletion mutation prevented the induced phosphorylation, degradative loss, and functional release of I kappa B alpha from NF-kappa B in Tax-expressing cells.
('Tax', 'Phosphorylation', 'I kappa B alpha'),('Tax', 'Protein_catabolism', 'I kappa B alpha')

Alanine substitutions introduced at two serine residues positioned within this N-terminal regulatory region of I kappa B alpha also yielded constitutive repressors that escaped from Tax-induced turnover and that potently inhibited immune activation pathways for NF-kappa B induction, including those initiated from antigen and cytokine receptors.

Overexpression of NF-IL6 enhanced expression of the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase reporter gene linked to the PRE-I-thymidine kinase or the human IL-4 promoter more than 10-fold in Jurkat cells.

Although GABP expression is not restricted to the hematopoietic lineage, its interaction with other specific factors may contribute to the tissue-specific expression of the gammac gene.
('GABP', 'Gene_expression', 'gammac')

Importantly, BMP-6 induced a rapid and marked increase in Smad-1/5/8 phosphorylation.
('BMP-6', 'Phosphorylation', 'Smad')

Furthermore, the BMP-6 induced Smad phosphorylation was followed by a selective upregulation of Id1 mRNA and subsequent Id1 protein.
('Smad', 'Positive_regulation', 'Id1'),('BMP-6', 'Positive_regulation', 'Id1'),('BMP-6', 'Phosphorylation', 'Smad')

Furthermore, BMP-2 has been shown to induce activation of STAT3 in myeloma cells [9].
('BMP-2', 'Positive_regulation', 'STAT3')

Upregulation of Id1 via Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation is a known mechanism for BMP-6 signalling in other cell systems [31,32] and regulation of Id-proteins is thought to be an important mechanism for Smad-signalling [17].
('Smad1', 'Positive_regulation', 'Id1'),('Smad', 'Positive_regulation', 'Id1'),('5', 'Positive_regulation', 'Id1'),('BMP-6', 'Positive_regulation', 'Id1'),('BMP-6', 'Phosphorylation', 'Smad'),('8', 'Positive_regulation', 'Id1')

In the present study, real-time RT-PCR experiments revealed a specific four-fold upregulation for Id1 in BMP-6-treated B cells, while the amount of Id2-Id4 remained unchanged.
('BMP-6', 'Positive_regulation', 'Id1'),('BMP-6', 'Gene_expression', 'Id2'),('BMP-6', 'Gene_expression', 'Id4')

Previously, Id1 has been considered not to be expressed in later developmental stages than pro-B cells [33,34], and its constitutive expression has been reported to impair mouse B cell development [35].
('5', 'Positive_regulation', 'Id1')

However, BMP-6 did not induce significant changes in the protein expression of Id2 and Id3.
('BMP-6', 'Gene_expression', 'Id2')

The antiproliferative and death inducing effect of BMP-6 in B cells with concomitant upregulation of Id1 protein is therefore in line with the view that Id proteins are required for the induction of growth arrest and apoptosis in B-lymphocyte progenitors by TGF-beta [40].
('BMP-6', 'Positive_regulation', 'Id1')

In this respect, it is of interest that targeted expression of Id1 to B-lymphocytes resulted in aberrant B cell development, massive apoptosis, and subsequent development of B cell lymphomas [35].
('5', 'Positive_regulation', 'Id1')

Moreover, BMP-6 has been suggested to play a role in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) [43,44] and elevated levels of Id1 and Id3 have been found in the synovia of RA-patients [45].

RFLAT-1: a new zinc finger transcription factor that activates RANTES gene expression in T lymphocytes.
('RFLAT-1', 'Gene_expression', 'RANTES')

Using expression cloning, we identified the first "late" T lymphocyte associated transcription factor and named it "RANTES Factor of Late Activated T Lymphocytes-1" (RFLAT-1).
('RFLAT-1', 'Gene_expression', 'RANTES')

RFLAT-1 is a novel, phosphorylated, zinc finger transcription factor that is expressed in T cells 3 days after activation, coincident with RANTES expression.
('RFLAT-1', 'Gene_expression', 'RANTES')

While Rel proteins play the dominant role in RANTES gene expression in fibroblasts, RFLAT-1 is a strong transactivator for RANTES in T cells.
('RFLAT-1', 'Gene_expression', 'RANTES')

The CD4+CD25-, CD45RA+, CD45RO+, and CD4+CD45RO+CD25- were able to significantly induce FOXP3 mRNA up to 30-fold upon TCR activation and addition of TGF-beta.
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

Th2 cells are known to produce IL-4 upon activation, which may interact with TGF-beta signaling and thus prevent FOXP3 induction.
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

However, the neutralization of IL-4 with a blocking IL-4 antibody did not rescue FOXP3 expression in the differentiated Th2 cells (unpublished data).
('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

Repeated exposure to TGF-beta did not further increase the FOXP3 expression in the iTreg lineage but transiently induced FOXP3 expression in Th1 cells.
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

Naturally occurring Th2 cells such as CRTH2+ T cells, T cells isolated according to their IL-4 secretion, or an IL-4-producing T cell clone (BR8) were also lacking FOXP3 expression (Figure 2B).
('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

Furthermore TGF-beta-mediated FOXP3 induction failed in these cells in contrast to the naive T cells (Figure 2B).
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

Because IL-4 is the key Th2 cytokine, the expression of IL-4 and FOXP3 in freshly isolated CD4+ T cells was analyzed by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS).
('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

IL-4-expressing cells were most abundant among CD45RO+CD25- cells, which did not co-express FOXP3 (Figure 3A, left panel).
('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

In contrast, CD45RO+CD25+ cells abundantly expressed FOXP3, while lacking IL-4 (Figure 3A, right panel).
('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

As shown in Figure 3B, the frequency of the IL-4+ cells was always below 1% in the FOXP3+ cells close to the background.
('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

The IL-4+ cells were confined to the FOXP3- cells, as shown for the CD45RO+CD25-, CD45RO+CD25+, and CD45RO+CD25+high cells (Figure 3B).
('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

The role of p16 in the E2F-dependent thymidine kinase regulation.
('p16', 'Regulation', 'thymidine kinase')

Phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein by cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 prevents its interaction with the transcription factor E2F, which subsequently promotes the expression of S phase regulated genes, such as thymidine kinase.
('6', 'Phosphorylation', 'retinoblastoma protein'),('cyclin-dependent kinases 4', 'Phosphorylation', 'retinoblastoma protein')

We investigated the regulation of thymidine kinase in phytohemagglutinin-stimulated normal human lymphocytes and in the p16-negative human acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines, MOLT-4 and CEM.
('p16', 'Regulation', 'thymidine kinase')

Transient expression of p16 in normal human lymphocytes caused arrest in G1, but was without effect on the cell growth of MOLT-4 and CEM cells, although all of them express functional retinoblastoma protein.
('6', 'Phosphorylation', 'retinoblastoma protein')

Nevertheless, in the two leukemia cell lines transient overexpression of p16 reestablished the normal regulation of thymidine kinase, paralleled by an increase of the underphosphorylated form of retinoblastoma protein and decrease of free E2F bound to its motif in the thymidine kinase promoter.
('6', 'Phosphorylation', 'retinoblastoma protein'),('p16', 'Regulation', 'thymidine kinase')

We demonstrate that loss of p16 causes upregulation of this DNA precursor pathway enzyme via activation of E2F by a mechanism involving retinoblastoma protein.
('6', 'Phosphorylation', 'retinoblastoma protein')

Triggering of HLA class II antigens by the anti-HLA-DR monoclonal antibody (mAb) L243 significantly (P < 0.05) and differentially enhanced the release of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) by the non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cells Ri-I, Ci-I, and Sc-I, which are at a distinct stage of B-cell differentiation, and by the more mature Burkitt lymphoma cell Raji; in contrast, it did not induce TNF-alpha release by the pre-B leukemia cells Nalm-6 and BV173.
('TNF-alpha', 'Localization', 'TNF-alpha')

TNF-alpha release peaked at 24 h and decreased thereafter, and it was dose dependent and preceded by an increase of TNF-alpha mRNA detectable after 3 h of stimulation with mAb L243.
('TNF-alpha', 'Localization', 'TNF-alpha')

Secreted TNF-alpha mediated the enhancement of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) and activator protein-1 (AP-1) binding activity; in fact, the triggering of HLA-DR antigens in the presence of antihuman TNF-alpha-neutralizing antibodies did not upregulate NF-kappa B and AP-1.
('TNF-alpha', 'Localization', 'TNF-alpha')

Altogether, our data demonstrate that: (a) the ability of B cells to release TNF-alpha after triggering of HLA-DR antigens depends on their stage of differentiation; (b) levels of released TNF-alpha seem to correlate with the stage of B-cell maturation but do not correlate with the amounts of cell surface HLA-DR antigens; (c) secreted TNF-alpha regulates the levels of expression of NF-kappa B and AP-1 by an autocrine loop; and (d) intracellular signals mediating TNF-alpha release by B cells are distinct from those regulating homotypic aggregation and proliferation.
('TNF-alpha', 'Localization', 'TNF-alpha')

By using Jurkat and primary human T lymphocytes, we demonstrate that the simultaneous activation of two second messengers of the TCR-initiated signal transduction, protein kinase C (PKC) and calcineurin, results in the synergistic activation of the IkappaBalpha kinase (IKK) complex but not of another putative IkappaBalpha kinase, p90(rsk).
('p90(rsk)', 'Phosphorylation', 'IkappaBalpha')

We also demonstrate that the IKK complex, but not p90(rsk), is responsible for the in vivo phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha mediated by the co-activation of PKC and calcineurin.
('p90(rsk)', 'Phosphorylation', 'IkappaBalpha')

Tat counteracts the IkappaB-alpha inhibition of p65 by competing the repressor binding
('Tat', 'Binding', 'IkappaB-alpha'),('IkappaB-alpha', 'Binding', 'p65')

We further investigated the physical interaction of Tat with IkappaB-alpha using in vitro translated proteins in coimmunoprecipitation assays.
('Tat', 'Binding', 'IkappaB-alpha')

For mapping the interaction domains, we used the following Tat mutants: Tat T,N(23,24)A, Tat C(22,25,27)A, Tat K(50,51)A and Tat R(49-57)A (Figure 3A).
('Tat', 'Binding', 'Tat')

IkappaB-alpha coimmunoprecipitated with all Tat proteins, except Tat R(49-57)A (Figure 3B).
('Tat', 'Binding', 'IkappaB-alpha'),('Tat R(49-57)A', 'Binding', 'IkappaB-alpha'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'Tat')

These results indicated that the arginine-rich domain of Tat was involved in the binding to IkappaB-alpha, which was consistent with previous observations (50,51).
('Tat', 'Binding', 'IkappaB-alpha')

Moreover, Tat associating with IkappaB-alpha competed the binding of IkappaB-alpha to p65 in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 3C, lanes 3-5), while Tat R(49-57)A, which lacked the binding site for IkappaB-alpha, did not associate with IkappaB-alpha and did not compete the binding of IkappaB-alpha to p65 (Figure 3C, lanes 6-8).
('Tat', 'Binding', 'IkappaB-alpha'),('Tat R(49-57)A', 'Binding', 'IkappaB-alpha'),('IkappaB-alpha', 'Binding', 'p65'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'Tat')

Next, we evaluated whether Tat counteracted the IkappaB-alpha-mediated inhibition of p65 binding to DNA by incubating in vitro translated p65 and IkappaB-alpha proteins with the NF-kappaB probe in presence or absence of Tat followed by EMSA.
('Tat', 'Binding', 'IkappaB-alpha'),('IkappaB-alpha', 'Binding', 'p65'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'Tat')

The p65 DNA binding activity was inhibited by IkappaB-alpha and restored in a dose-dependent manner by wild-type Tat, and not by Tat R(49-57) (Figure 3D).
('Tat', 'Binding', 'IkappaB-alpha'),('IkappaB-alpha', 'Binding', 'p65'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'Tat')

Further, we analysed the Tat effect on the IkappaB-alpha repression of p65 transcriptional activity by transfecting p50-/-p65-/-MEFs with the NF-kappaB-Luc reporter together with expression vectors of p65 and IkappaB-alpha, in presence or absence of Tat.
('Tat', 'Binding', 'IkappaB-alpha'),('IkappaB-alpha', 'Binding', 'p65'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'Tat')

IkappaB-alpha inhibited the p65-dependent expression of the luciferase gene, which was restored in a dose-dependent manner by wild-type Tat, and not by Tat R(49-57)A (Figure 3E).

Altogether these results indicated that Tat counteracts the IkappaB-alpha repression of the p65 DNA-binding and transcriptional activity by associating with IkappaB-alpha and competing the repressor binding to p65.

In both T cells and HeLa cells HIV-1 Tat suppressed the expression of Mn-dependent superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD), a mitochondrial enzyme that is part of the cellular defense system against oxidative stress.
('Tat', 'Transcription', 'Mn-SOD'),('Tat', 'Gene_expression', 'Mn-SOD')

Thus, Mn-SOD RNA protein levels and activity were markedly reduced in the presence of Tat.
('Tat', 'Transcription', 'Mn-SOD'),('Tat', 'Gene_expression', 'Mn-SOD')

A truncated Tat protein (Tat1-72), known to transactivate the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR), no longer affected Mn-SOD expression, the cellular redox state or TNF-mediated cytotoxicity.
('Tat', 'Transcription', 'Mn-SOD'),('Tat', 'Gene_expression', 'Mn-SOD')

Thus, our experiments demonstrate that the C-terminal region of HIV-1 Tat is required to suppress Mn-SOD expression and to induce pro-oxidative conditions reflected by a drop in reduced glutathione (GSH) and the GSH:oxidized GSH (GSSG) ratio.

In co-transfection experiments, the galectin-3 promoter was significantly up-regulated by expression vectors encoding the 40-kd Tax protein, a potent transactivator in HTLV-I.
('Tax', 'Localization', 'galectin-3'),('Tax', 'Transcription', 'galectin-3')

Analysis of various Tax mutants suggested that galectin-3 promoter induction is dependent on activation of the cyclic-AMP-responsive element binding protein/activation transcription factor family of transcription factors and, to a lesser extent, nuclear factor-kappa B/Rel induction.
('Tax', 'Localization', 'galectin-3'),('Tax', 'Transcription', 'galectin-3')

Functionally, galectin-3 was shown to activate interleukin-2 production in Jurkat T cells.
('galectin-3', 'Gene_expression', 'interleukin-2')

Together, these findings raise the possibility that HTLV-I Tax production induces the transcription and subsequent synthesis and secretion of galectin-3, which in turn may further activate these T cells and contribute to the altered properties of cell growth found in adult T cell leukemia induced by HTLV-I.

In fetal liver of PU.1-/- mice, which lack lymphoid and myeloid cells, expression of Btk was reduced two- to threefold but not abolished.

('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65'),('p65', 'Binding', 'p65')

We tested whether Tat physically interacted with p65.
('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65')

HeLa cells were transfected with the expression vectors of HA-p65 and FLAG-Tat, and 24 h later Tat was immunoprecipitated from cell extracts.
('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65')

The p65 protein was coimmunoprecipitated with wild-type Tat or the mutants Tat T,N(23,24)A, Tat K(50,51)A and Tat R(49-57)A at similar levels, while a significant decrease in coimmunoprecipitation was observed for Tat C(22,25,27)A (Figure 4A).
('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65'),('Tat C(22,25,27)A', 'Binding', 'p65')

Consistently, GST-pull down of in vitro translated proteins showed the direct binding of p65 to wild-type Tat, or the mutants Tat T,N(23,24)A, Tat K(50,51)A and Tat R(49-57)A, and lack of binding to Tat C(22,25,27)A (Figure 4B).
('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65'),('Tat C(22,25,27)A', 'Binding', 'p65')

These results indicated that Tat associated with p65 through the cysteine-rich domain and ruled-out the requirement of bridging proteins to mediate such interaction.
('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65')

To identify the p65 domain required for binding to Tat, HeLa cells were transfected with FLAG-Tat together with HA-p65 mutants, which were deleted of the transactivation domain [p65deltaC (1-318)], or the RHD [p65deltaN (122-551)] (Figure 4C).
('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65'),('p65', 'Binding', 'p65')

Tat coimmunoprecipitated with p65deltaC (1-318), and not with p65deltaN (122-551) (Figure 4D), indicating that the RHD of p65 was involved in the physical interaction with Tat.
('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65'),('p65', 'Binding', 'p65')

To address the effect of Tat on the p65 DNA-binding affinity, purified recombinant p65 protein was incubated with 32P-labeled-NF-kappaB double-stranded oligonucleotide in presence or absence of wild-type Tat or Tat C(22,25,27)A, and p65 DNA-binding was analysed by EMSA.
('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65'),('Tat C(22,25,27)A', 'Binding', 'p65'),('p65', 'Binding', 'p65')

Whereas wild-type Tat significantly increased the binding of p65 to DNA, the mutant Tat C(22,25,27)A, lacking the binding site for p65, was ineffective (Figure 4E).
('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65'),('Tat C(22,25,27)A', 'Binding', 'p65'),('p65', 'Binding', 'p65')

We observed no genetic alterations in the IRF-4 promoter, which can account for the lack of IRF-4 expression: The detected base pair changes at position -1081 (T to C substitution), at position -1068 (A to C substitution) and at position -116 (A to C substitution) are unlikely responsible for absent IRF-4-expression since the first two mutations were found both in IRF-4-positive and -negative cells whereas the latter change was not detected consistently in all IRF-4-negative or -positive cells and may thus be a polymorphism.
('IRF-4', 'Binding', 'IRF-4'),('IRF-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'IRF-4')

Since IRF-4 expression in cell lines and CML can be induced by demethylation and successful IFN-alpha therapy (3), respectively, the existence of such genetic aberrations seems unlikely.
('IFN-alpha', 'Gene_expression', 'IRF-4')

We then investigated whether the previously described down-regulation of IRF-4 expression in human myeloid leukemias was due to a differential hypermethylation of the promoter, since the presented re-expression due to AzadC-treatment might also be a result of activation of positive transcriptional regulators of IRF-4.
('IRF-4', 'Binding', 'IRF-4'),('IRF-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'IRF-4')

We found that IRF-4 expression could indeed be connected to the methylation status of distinct CpG motifs in the IRF-4 promoter.
('IRF-4', 'Binding', 'IRF-4'),('IRF-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'IRF-4')

At two further CpG sites (#48, 45) the methylation status in IRF-4-positive was lower than that of IRF-4-negative cells.
('IRF-4', 'Binding', 'IRF-4'),('IRF-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'IRF-4')

It has been shown that NFkappaB elements play an important role in IRF-4 induction as IRF-4 expression depends on binding of the transactivator c-Rel to these elements in the IRF-4 promoter (31,37).
('c-Rel', 'Gene_expression', 'IRF-4'),('IRF-4', 'Binding', 'IRF-4'),('IRF-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'IRF-4')

Via in vitro methylation and reporter gene assays we could clearly appoint the silencing of the IRF-4 promoter to a methylation effect, which may thus be the mechanism of IRF-4 deregulation in vivo.
('IRF-4', 'Binding', 'IRF-4'),('IRF-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'IRF-4')

The finding that IRF-4 expression is silenced by promoter hypermethylation might represent a mechanism that accounts for the previously observed loss of IRF-4 expression in CML.
('IRF-4', 'Binding', 'IRF-4'),('IRF-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'IRF-4')

Still, the obvious functional diversity of IRF-4 remains remarkable and cannot be fully explained by the IRF-4 promoter methylation status.
('IRF-4', 'Binding', 'IRF-4'),('IRF-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'IRF-4')

In multiple myeloma (MM) a translocation on chromosome 14q was reported to lead to a fusion gene of immunoglobulin heavy-chain (IgH) and IRF-4 resulting in a subsequent overexpression of IRF-4 (48,49).
('IRF-4', 'Binding', 'IRF-4'),('IRF-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'IRF-4')

Down-regulation of IRF-4 may promote leukemogenesis in myeloid cell context (3), which was recently confirmed in IRF-4-/- ICSBP-/- double knock-out mice (53), while IRF-4 up-regulation may induce a growth advantage in lymphomas or MM (48).
('IRF-4', 'Binding', 'IRF-4'),('IRF-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'IRF-4')

Taken together, our data suggest that IRF-4 promoter methylation regulates IRF-4 expression, and that aberrant expression of IRF-4 in certain types of leukemia may be a consequence of IRF-4 promoter hypermethylation.
('IRF-4', 'Binding', 'IRF-4'),('IRF-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'IRF-4')

Runx3-deficient T cells fail to silence CD4 expression normally (Fig.
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'CD4')

We therefore further fractionated the positively selected CD8+ T cells from Runx3 KO mice into CD8+CD4- SP or CD8+CD4+ DP cells by separation using anti-CD4 magnetic beads.
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'CD4')

This yielded a Runx3 KO SP "enriched" population that contained 75% CD8+CD4- cells and a KO DP enriched population that contained 85% CD8+CD4+ cells (Fig.
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'CD4')

As previously reported, TCR-induced proliferation of Runx3-/- CD8+ T cells was severely impaired, irrespective of CD4 expression (Fig.
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'CD4')

Although a fraction of the KO DP cells silenced CD4 expression after activation, the ratio of SP/DP cells in each enriched population remained constant thereafter, and we did not observe any major differences between these two populations throughout the culture period, indicating that in terms of effector CTL differentiation and under our culture conditions, Runx3-/- CD8+ T cells that also coexpress CD4 are indistinguishable from those that do not.
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'CD4')

The Transactivation Functions of HTLV-I Tax Are Suppressed by Foxp3
('Foxp3', 'Transcription', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

Since the HTLV-I Tax protein can function at multiple levels in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus to stimulate activation of NF-kappaB [28,29], we hypothesized that overexpression of Foxp3 may interfere with this process.
('Foxp3', 'Transcription', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

However, since Tax-dependent HTLV-I gene expression is independent of NF-kappaB [18], we also hypothesized that Foxp3 would not affect Tax-dependent activation of the HTLV-I LTR.
('Foxp3', 'Transcription', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

To test these hypotheses, we overexpressed HTLV-I Tax, full-length Foxp3, and/or deltaFKH in HEK 293T cells cotransfected with an HTLV-I LTR or NF-kappaB reporter vector.
('deltaFKH', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Transcription', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

Interestingly, overexpression of Foxp3, but not deltaFKH, suppressed Tax-mediated activation of NF-kappaB-dependent transcription.
('deltaFKH', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Transcription', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

These observations further suggest that the carboxyl-terminal FKH domain is required for inhibiting activation of NF-kappaB in the presence of Tax in HEK 293T cells, strikingly similar to the requirements of Foxp3 inhibition of basal NF-kappaB activation shown in Figure 2B.
('Foxp3', 'Transcription', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

Transactivation of the HTLV-I LTR was stimulated about 55-fold by overexpression of Tax (Figure 4B), while transfection of Foxp3 suppressed Tax-dependent HTLV-I LTR activation, although HTLV-I LTR activation in the presence or absence of Tax is independent of NF-kappaB or NF-AT (another transcriptional activator known to interact with Foxp3).
('Foxp3', 'Transcription', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

Furthermore, overexpression of deltaFKH also led to suppression of HTLV-I transactivation by Tax to a similar extent as full-length Foxp3 (Figure 4B).
('deltaFKH', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Transcription', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

The suppressive effects shown in Figure 4A and 4B were not the result of Foxp3 down-regulating the expression of the transfected Tax plasmid as determined by real-time RT-PCR (Figure 4C).
('Foxp3', 'Transcription', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

These results strongly suggest that Foxp3 interacts with transcriptional regulators in addition to NF-kappaB and NF-AT, and that the carboxyl-terminal FKH domain, and therefore localization to the nucleus, are not required for inhibition of Tax-mediated HTLV-I LTR activation (even in HEK 293T cells).
('Foxp3', 'Transcription', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

To determine whether Foxp3 inhibited the transactivation functions of Tax by directly associating with this viral protein, we generated an expression vector in which HTLV-I Tax was fused in-frame to the carboxyl terminus of the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (Gal4-BD).
('Foxp3', 'Transcription', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

Transactivation of the Gal4-resposive promoter by Gal4-BD-Tax remained relatively unaffected by overexpression of either EGFP (control), Foxp3, or deltaFKH, suggesting that Foxp3 does not repress Tax transactivation by directly interfacing with the HTLV-I Tax protein.
('deltaFKH', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Transcription', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

As illustrated in Figure 5, the level of Tax mRNA synthesized from ACH was down-regulated in the presence of Foxp3 compared to the level produced in the presence of the control vector.
('Foxp3', 'Transcription', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

deltaFKH did not have a discernable affect on Tax expression.
('deltaFKH', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

These data indicate that Foxp3 is capable of repressing the expression of Tax from an infectious HTLV-I molecular clone.

The gp160-induced NF-kappa B complex consists of p65, p50 and c-rel proteins.

The latter has evolved a mechanism to counteract A3G activity by expressing the regulatory protein Vif (4).
('Vif', 'Negative_regulation', 'A3G'),('Vif', 'Protein_catabolism', 'A3G')

Vif induces proteasomal degradation of A3G and additionally inhibits A3G activity by further mechanisms (8, 37-43).
('Vif', 'Negative_regulation', 'A3G'),('Vif', 'Protein_catabolism', 'A3G')

To investigate whether the overexpression of HIV-1 proteins also influences A3G promoter activity, we either expressed HIV-1 Vif or the HIV-1 Tat protein, the latter has been shown to activate different viral and cellular promoters (44,45).
('Vif', 'Negative_regulation', 'A3G'),('Vif', 'Protein_catabolism', 'A3G')

Luciferase assays showed that the transcriptional activity of the A3G promoter was not significantly altered in the presence of Vif, Tat or HIV-1NL4-3 (Figure 4A), suggesting that HIV-1 is not modulating A3G expression on the transcriptional level.
('Vif', 'Negative_regulation', 'A3G'),('Vif', 'Protein_catabolism', 'A3G')

Deletion analysis of the carboxyl-terminal region of Stat6 and recombination of this region with a heterologous DNA binding domain allowed the delimitation and characterization of the transactivation domain of Stat6.
('Stat6', 'Regulation', 'Stat6')

IL-4 activates gene expression by inducing tyrosine phosphorylation, homodimerization, and nuclear translocation of the latent transcription factor, STAT6 (signal transducer and activator of transcription-6).
('IL-4', 'Phosphorylation', 'STAT6'),('IL-4', 'Localization', 'STAT6'),('IL-4', 'Binding', 'STAT6')

STAT6-responsive elements are characteristically present in the promoters of IL-4-inducible genes.
('IL-4', 'Phosphorylation', 'STAT6'),('IL-4', 'Localization', 'STAT6'),('IL-4', 'Binding', 'STAT6')

Because STAT6 activation is essential for IL-4-induced gene expression, we examined the ability of type I and type II IFNs to regulate activation of STAT6 by IL-4 in primary human monocytes.
('IL-4', 'Phosphorylation', 'STAT6'),('IL-4', 'Localization', 'STAT6'),('IL-4', 'Binding', 'STAT6')

Pretreatment of monocytes with IFN-beta or IFN-gamma, but not IL-1, IL-2, macrophage colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor, IL-6, or transforming growth factor beta suppressed activation of STAT6 by IL-4.
('IFN-gamma', 'Positive_regulation', 'STAT6'),('IL-1', 'Positive_regulation', 'STAT6'),('transforming growth factor beta', 'Positive_regulation', 'STAT6'),('IL-4', 'Phosphorylation', 'STAT6'),('IL-6', 'Positive_regulation', 'STAT6'),('IL-4', 'Localization', 'STAT6'),('IL-4', 'Binding', 'STAT6'),('IFN-beta', 'Positive_regulation', 'STAT6'),('IL-2', 'Positive_regulation', 'STAT6')

This inhibition was associated with decreased tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT6 and was not evident unless the cells were preincubated with IFN for at least 1 hr before IL-4 stimulation.
('IL-4', 'Phosphorylation', 'STAT6'),('IL-4', 'Localization', 'STAT6'),('IL-4', 'Binding', 'STAT6')

These findings demonstrate that IFNs inhibit IL-4-induced activation of STAT6 and STAT6-dependent gene expression, at least in part, by inducing expression of SOCS-1.
('IL-4', 'Phosphorylation', 'STAT6'),('IL-4', 'Localization', 'STAT6'),('IL-4', 'Binding', 'STAT6')

Although three sites in the TNF-alpha promoter (kappa 1, kappa 2, and kappa 3) specifically bind the transcription factor NF-kappa B in lymphoid nuclear extracts, TNF-alpha mRNA induction by PMA does not correlate with NF-kappa B binding activities displayed by different T and B cell lines.
('TNF-alpha', 'Positive_regulation', 'TNF-alpha')

STAT1 activity was evident on the STAT binding sequences (SBE) present in the promoters of genes which are up-regulated during monocyte to macrophage maturation such as FcgammaRI and ICAM-1, and in the promoter of the transcription factor IFN regulatory factor-1.
('STAT1', 'Gene_expression', 'ICAM-1'),('STAT1', 'Gene_expression', 'FcgammaRI')

Taken together these results indicate that STAT1 plays a pivotal role in the differentiation/maturation process of monocytes as an early transcription factor initially activated by adherence and then able to modulate the expression of functional genes, such as ICAM-1 and FcgammaRI.
('STAT1', 'Gene_expression', 'ICAM-1'),('STAT1', 'Gene_expression', 'FcgammaRI')

In our previous study, we demonstrated a major positive regulatory role for GATA-1 and a negative regulatory role for GATA-2 in MBP gene transcription.
('GATA-1', 'Transcription', 'MBP'),('GATA-2', 'Transcription', 'MBP')

Furthermore, we have demonstrated that both C/EBPbeta and GATA-1 can bind simultaneously to the C/EBP- and GATA-binding sites in the MBP promoter.
('GATA-1', 'Transcription', 'MBP')

To determine the functionality of both the C/EBP- and GATA- binding sites, we analyzed whether C/EBPbeta and GATA-1 can stimulate the MBP promoter in the C/EBPbeta and GATA-1 negative Jurkat T-cell line.
('GATA-1', 'Transcription', 'MBP')

Expression of FOG (riend ATA), which binds to GATA-1 and acts as a cofactor for GATA-binding proteins, decreased transactivation activity of GATA-1 for the MBP promoter in a dose-dependent manner.
('GATA-1', 'Transcription', 'MBP')

However, stimulated SHARPIN-deficient BMDC had reduced transcription and secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators IL6, IL12P70, GMCSF, and nitric oxide.

We previously showed that the TRAF family member TRAF2 mediates recruitment of HOIL-1L-interacting protein (HOIP) to the cytoplasmic domain of CD40, suggesting that HOIP has a role in the CD40 signaling pathway.
('TRAF2', 'Binding', 'HOIL-1L-interacting protein')

We found that the CD40-induced upregulation of CD80 and activation of germline immunoglobulin epsilon transcription were defective in HOIP-deficient cells.
('CD40', 'Positive_regulation', 'CD80')

IL-4, a product of the T-helper 0 (Th0) and 2 (Th2) subset, was originally described as a B-cell stimulatory factor and has subsequently been found to suppress IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-alpha gene expression in monocytes stimulated with LPS, and to upregulate IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL1-RA) gene expression.
('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', '(IL1-RA'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-8'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-1 beta'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'TNF-alpha')

('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-8'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-1 beta'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'TNF-alpha')

IL-4 also suppressed the IL-2-induced IL-6 mRNA expression.
('IL-2', 'Transcription', 'IL-6')

IL-4 did not exert significant influence on the induction of expression of IL-1-RA or various CSFs by IL-2, IL-3, and GM-CSF.

Enhanced IL-2 transcription correlates with increased c-fos synthesis and increased Fos content of AP-1.
('c-fos', 'Transcription', 'IL-2')

We therefore examined the effects of EC on T cell nuclear factors known to regulate IL-2 transcription, including c-jun and c-fos-two components of the transcription factor AP-1, NFAT, and others.

TNF is the major inducer of NF-kappaB and particularly of the p50-p65 complex, whereas IL-7 acts as a cofactor by sustaining the expression of the p75 TNF receptor.

Additionally, we aimed to define a regulatory role for the C-terminal tail of RPS3 whose function was unknown.Here we show that the Inhibitor of kappaB (IkappaB) kinase beta (IKKbeta) phosphorylated RPS3 at serine 209 (S209).
('RPS3', 'Binding', 'RPS3')

To address the mechanisms regulating IL-10 production by Th1 cells invivo, we transferred DO11.10 cells into BALB/c recipient mice and immunized the recipients with very high doses of OVA-protein with or without added lipopolysacharide (LPS).
('OVA', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

This invivo immunization induced IL-10 and IFN-gamma production, and the amount of IL-10 production was enhanced by addition of LPS in the immunization (Figure3A) and with higher doses of OVA (3 muM versus 1 muM, data not shown).
('OVA', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

To test the role of STAT4 and STAT6 signaling in the invivo development of IL-10-producing Th1 cells, we transferred STAT4- or STAT6-deficient or WT DO11.10 cells into recipient BALB/c mice and immunized with OVA-protein plus LPS as before.

GATA3 Represses the FOXP3 Promoter
('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

To investigate the molecular mechanism of GATA3-mediated repression of human FOXP3, the human FOXP3 promoter was studied and a palindromic binding site for GATA3 was discovered.
('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('FOXP3', 'Regulation', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

We transfected human primary CD4+ T cells, in vitro differentiated Th2 cells, and Jurkat cells (Jurkat cells are known to constitutively express GATA3 [25,26]), and we measured FOXP3 promoter activity.
('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

Overexpression of GATA3 in naive T cells diminished luciferase activity of the FOXP3 promoter compared with the control vector (Figure 8B).
('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

This mutation increased luciferase activity by 3-fold in memory CD4+CD45RO+ T cells, whereas no difference was observed in naive (GATA3-) CD4+CD45RA+ T cells, revealing a repressor activity of GATA3 on the FOXP3 promoter (Figure 8C).
('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

Furthermore GATA3 binds directly to the FOXP3 promoter as investigated by pull-down assay.
('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

HEK cells were transiently transfected with GATA3 or a control vector, and increasing amounts of lysates were incubated with oligonucleotides containing the GATA3 site of the FOXP3 promoter or a control oligonucleotide with a mutated GATA3-binding site.
('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

These experiments demonstrated that GATA3 binds the palindromic FOXP3 promoter.
('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

To gain insights into the in vivo situation, we performed a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) using an anti-GATA3 antibody and showed that GATA3 binds to the FOXP3 promoter region in Th2 cells, but not in iTreg cells (Figure 7F).
('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

Taken together these data demonstrate that the GATA3-binding to the FOXP3 promoter is repressing FOXP3 expression.

Runx3-deficient T cells fail to silence CD4 expression normally (Fig.
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'CD4')

We therefore further fractionated the positively selected CD8+ T cells from Runx3 KO mice into CD8+CD4- SP or CD8+CD4+ DP cells by separation using anti-CD4 magnetic beads.
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'CD4')

This yielded a Runx3 KO SP "enriched" population that contained 75% CD8+CD4- cells and a KO DP enriched population that contained 85% CD8+CD4+ cells (Fig.
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'CD4')

As previously reported, TCR-induced proliferation of Runx3-/- CD8+ T cells was severely impaired, irrespective of CD4 expression (Fig.
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'CD4')

Although a fraction of the KO DP cells silenced CD4 expression after activation, the ratio of SP/DP cells in each enriched population remained constant thereafter, and we did not observe any major differences between these two populations throughout the culture period, indicating that in terms of effector CTL differentiation and under our culture conditions, Runx3-/- CD8+ T cells that also coexpress CD4 are indistinguishable from those that do not.
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'CD4')

This study demonstrates that RUNX transcription factors 1 and 3 play an important role in the generation of FOXP3+ iT reg cells by TGF-beta.
('RUNX', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'RUNX'),('TGF-beta', 'Transcription', 'RUNX'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

TGF-beta mediates RUNX induction and FOXP3 is efficiently up-regulated by RUNX1 and RUNX3 in human CD4+ T cells.
('RUNX', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'RUNX'),('TGF-beta', 'Transcription', 'RUNX'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

There are three putative RUNX binding sites in the proximal FOXP3 promoter.
('RUNX', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

The RUNX protein that actually induces the expression of FOXP3 might therefore be dependent on the availability of the specific RUNX family member at certain stages of T cell development.
('RUNX', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

It was shown that TGF-beta is mandatory for the maintenance of peripheral T reg cells and their expression of Foxp3 (Marie et al., 2005; Rubtsov and Rudensky, 2007).
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3')

RUNX transcription factors are targets of the TGF-beta superfamily and they are involved in the TGF-beta pathway.
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'RUNX'),('TGF-beta', 'Transcription', 'RUNX')

TGF-beta can activate RUNX genes at the transcriptional level, and at the posttranscriptional level through activation or stabilization of RUNX proteins (Jin et al., 2004).
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'RUNX'),('TGF-beta', 'Transcription', 'RUNX')

It was shown that RUNX2 regulates the expression of TGF-beta type I receptor (Ji et al., 2001), suggesting that other mechanisms for their function could be involved.
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'RUNX'),('TGF-beta', 'Transcription', 'RUNX'),('RUNX2', 'Gene_expression', 'TGF-beta type I receptor')

The fusion proteins RUNX1-EVI1 and RUNX1-ETO block TGF-beta inhibition of leukemic cell growth.
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'RUNX'),('TGF-beta', 'Transcription', 'RUNX')

RUNX3 plays an important role in TGF-beta-mediated growth control in epithelial cells, as loss of RUNX3 leads to decreased sensitivity to TGF-beta and hyperproliferation of the gastric mucosa (Blyth et al., 2005).
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'RUNX'),('TGF-beta', 'Transcription', 'RUNX')

We observed that single siRNA interference of either RUNX1 or RUNX3 alone shows a slight decrease in Foxp3+ T reg cell induction, which could be caused by redundancy of these proteins.
('RUNX1', 'Positive_regulation', 'Foxp3'),('RUNX3', 'Positive_regulation', 'Foxp3')

Foxp3 induction by TGF-beta is reduced in CD4+ T cells of CbfbF/F CD4-cre mice compared with CbfbF/+ CD4-cre mice.
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3'),('Cbfb', 'Negative_regulation', 'Foxp3')

We observed an increased number of Foxp3+ cells by retinoic acid and TGF-beta compared with TGF-beta treatment alone in CbfbF/+ CD4-cre mice and CbfbF/F CD4-cre mice.
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3'),('Cbfb', 'Negative_regulation', 'Foxp3')

These data in mice confirm the human data that RUNX proteins play an important role for TGF-beta-dependent FOXP3 induction, as well as in the suppressive capacity of iT reg cells.
('RUNX', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'RUNX'),('TGF-beta', 'Transcription', 'RUNX'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

As an additional support for this concept, the overexpression of RUNX1 induced increased FOXP3 protein expression without any requirement of TGF-beta and anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 stimulation in human primary CD4+ cells.
('RUNX', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'RUNX'),('TGF-beta', 'Transcription', 'RUNX'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

Cbfb-deficient nT reg cells progressively lose Foxp3 upon division, and there is no evidence of increased death of Cbfb-deficient nT reg cells in that study.
('Cbfb', 'Negative_regulation', 'Foxp3')

The experiments in Cbfb-deficient CD4-cre T cells in mice and the knockdown experiments in humans in this study suggest that the induction of Foxp3 expression is a major contributing factor in the in vivo conversion experiment.
('Cbfb', 'Negative_regulation', 'Foxp3')

Whether the diminished capacity of Cbfb-deficient CD4-cre T cells in the generation of Foxp3 may be caused by peripheral expansion of Cbfb-deficient non-T reg cells or survival problems faced by Cbfb-deficient iT reg cells after Foxp3 induction remains to be elucidated.
('Cbfb', 'Negative_regulation', 'Foxp3'),('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'Foxp3')

Runx3/Cbfbeta are both required for the activation of the Ifng gene and silencing of the Il4 gene in Th1 cells (Djuretic et al., 2007; Naoe et al., 2007).
('Cbfbeta', 'Negative_regulation', 'Il4'),('Cbfbeta', 'Positive_regulation', 'Ifng'),('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'Ifng'),('Runx3', 'Negative_regulation', 'Il4')

Furthermore, it was shown that Runx1 activates IL-2 and IFN-gamma gene expression in conventional CD4+ T cells by binding to their respective promoter.
('Runx1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2'),('Runx1', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma')

RUNX1 interacts physically with Foxp3 protein, and it was demonstrated that this interaction might be responsible for the suppression of IL-2 and IFN-gamma production and up-regulation of T reg cell-associated molecules (Ono et al., 2007).
('RUNX1', 'Positive_regulation', 'Foxp3')

Specifically, Foxp3 physically interacts with RORgammat, and this interaction inhibits RORgammat function (Zhou et al., 2008).
('Foxp3', 'Negative_regulation', 'RORgammat')

This relationship of RORgammat and Foxp3 and probably yet unknown mechanisms might be the basis of the observation that the differentiation of Th17 cells and T reg cells is often reciprocal (Bettelli et al., 2006).
('Foxp3', 'Negative_regulation', 'RORgammat')

Recently, data suggests that Runx1 may also be involved in regulating Il17 transcription, functioning in complex with RORgammat to activate transcription (Zhang et al., 2008).
('Runx1', 'Transcription', 'Il17')

We have shown a link between Foxp3 induction in iT reg cells and RUNX1 and RUNX3.

RUNX proteins play a central role in pathways regulating cell growth and differentiation, and their interaction with the TGF-beta pathway is of particular interest.
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'RUNX'),('TGF-beta', 'Transcription', 'RUNX')

NFAT forms a complex with AP-1 and NF-kappaB and regulates the expression of IL-2, IL-4, IFN-gamma, and CTLA4 in conventional T cells, which leads to the activation and differentiation to effector T cells (Dolganov et al., 1996; Hu et al., 2007).
('AP-1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2'),('AP-1', 'Gene_expression', 'CTLA4'),('AP-1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-4'),('AP-1', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma')

The NFAT-AP-1 complex also binds to the Foxp3 promoter after TCR triggering and regulates its gene expression positively (Mantel et al., 2006).
('AP-1', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3')

It was shown that NFAT and Smad3 cooperate to induce Foxp3 expression through its enhancer (Tone et al., 2008), but no TGF-beta response element was identified in the Foxp3 gene or in the surrounding regions.
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3'),('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'Foxp3'),('Smad3', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3')

The initial induction of RUNX1 and RUNX3 and the subsequent binding of these transcription factors to the Foxp3 promoter that we showed here might explain the relatively late induction of Foxp3 mRNA that peaks 24-48 h after stimulation.
('RUNX1', 'Positive_regulation', 'Foxp3'),('RUNX3', 'Positive_regulation', 'Foxp3'),('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'Foxp3')

Similar to this interaction, NFAT may also cooperate with RUNX1 or RUNX3 to activate Foxp3, but further studies are necessary to elaborate on this concept.
('RUNX1', 'Positive_regulation', 'Foxp3'),('RUNX3', 'Positive_regulation', 'Foxp3')

The induction of the transcription factors RUNX1 and RUNX3 by TGF-beta and the subsequent up-regulation of Foxp3 play a role in iT reg cell generation and its suppressive capacity.

IL-10 Production by Th2 and Th17 Cells Also Requires ERK1 and ERK2 Activation
('ERK2', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('ERK1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

To address whether IL-10 production by Th2 and Th17 cells was also dependent on ERK1 and ERK2 activation, we differentiated these cells with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 in the absence of APCs (Shoemaker etal., 2006; Veldhoen etal., 2009; Veldhoen etal., 2006), in the presence or absence of the MEK inhibitor (PD184352).
('ERK2', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('ERK1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('MEK', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

We showed that ERK1 and ERK2 activation is a common pathway required for induction of IL-10 in different Th cell subsets because IL-10 production by both Th2 and Th17 cells was markedly inhibited in the presence of the MEK inhibitor (PD184352) (Figure5D and FigureS5B).
('ERK2', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('ERK1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('MEK', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Activation of the ERK1 and ERK2 signaling pathway is therefore a common requirement for the induction of IL-10 production by Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells.
('ERK2', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('ERK1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

The activity of the promoter regulating the synthesis of the p105 precursor of the NF-kappa B p50 subunit was enhanced in these cells.
('p50', 'Positive_regulation', 'p105')

These observations indicate that during chronic HIV infection of U937 cells, continuous NF-kappa B (p50/p65) translocation results in p105 promoter upregulation with subsequent cytosolic NF-kappa B accumulation, ready for further translocation.

The Th2-type cytokines, interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13), induce expression of a distinct subset of genes in human monocytes, including FcepsilonRIIb (CD23), 15-lipoxygenase, IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), and type I and type II IL-1 receptors (IL-1R).

Involvement of Egr-1/RelA synergy in distinguishing T cell activation from tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced NF-kappa B1 transcription.
('Egr-1', 'Gene_expression', 'NF-kappa B1'),('Egr-1', 'Positive_regulation', 'NF-kappa B1'),('tumor necrosis factor-alpha', 'Transcription', 'NF-kappa B1'),('Egr-1', 'Positive_regulation', 'RelA')

In this manuscript we have investigated the molecular mechanisms by which T cell lines stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and phytohemagglutin (PHA) display significantly higher levels of NF-kappa B1 encoding transcripts than cells stimulated with tumor necrosis factor-alpha, despite the fact that both stimuli activate NF-kappa B.
('PHA', 'Transcription', 'NF-kappa B1'),('tumor necrosis factor-alpha', 'Transcription', 'NF-kappa B1')

Characterization of the NF-kappa B1 promoter identified an Egr-1 site which was found to be essential for both the PMA/PHA-mediated induction as well as the synergistic activation observed after the expression of the RelA subunit of NF-kappa B and Egr-1.
('PHA', 'Transcription', 'NF-kappa B1'),('Egr-1', 'Gene_expression', 'NF-kappa B1'),('Egr-1', 'Positive_regulation', 'NF-kappa B1'),('Egr-1', 'Positive_regulation', 'RelA')

Furthermore, Egr-1 induction was required for endogenous NF-kappa B1 gene expression, since PMA/PHA-stimulated T cell lines expressing antisense Egr-1 RNA were inhibited in their ability to upregulate NF-kappa B1 transcription.
('PHA', 'Transcription', 'NF-kappa B1'),('Egr-1', 'Gene_expression', 'NF-kappa B1'),('Egr-1', 'Positive_regulation', 'NF-kappa B1')

Our studies indicate that transcriptional synergy mediated by activation of both Egr-1 and NF-kappa B may have important ramifications in T cell development by upregulating NF-kappa B1 gene expression.
('Egr-1', 'Gene_expression', 'NF-kappa B1'),('Egr-1', 'Positive_regulation', 'NF-kappa B1')

We also found that IL-2 protects T cell clones from IL-2 deprivation apoptosis accompanying active proliferation and enhanced expression of P53, Rb and Bcl-xL proteins.

Compared with monocytes in suspension or adherent on plastic surfaces, monocytes adherent to fibronectin or RGD exhibited a greater than threefold increase in steady state levels of IFN-gamma-induced mRNA for the high affinity Fc gammaRI receptor.

Runx3 controls multiple aspects of the CTL differentiation program, in part through induction of Eomes
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'Eomes'),('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'Eomes')

Strikingly, Runx3-/- CD8+ T cells were strongly impaired in their ability to differentiate into effector CTLs, as judged by expression of perforin, granzyme B, and IFN-gamma (Fig.
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'granzyme B'),('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'granzyme B'),('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'perforin')

Compared with WT T cells, perforin mRNA and protein expression were essentially undetectable in Runx3-/- T cells at day 6 of culture (Fig.
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'perforin')

Runx3-/- T cells also had no detectable Eomes expression; in contrast, T-bet expression was unimpaired (Fig.
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'Eomes'),('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'Eomes')

Furthermore, Runx3 was required for maximal production of IFN-gamma, but not TNF or IL-2, by CD8+ T cells restimulated at day 6 (Fig.
('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'TNF')

We previously reported that Th1 cell differentiation was regulated through a feed-forward loop in which T-bet is up-regulated early and induces Runx3, after which T-bet and Runx3 cooperate to induce IFN-gamma and silence IL-4, thus promoting stable differentiation toward the Th1 lineage (15, 22).
('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma')

Because (a) Runx3 appeared necessary for Eomes induction (Fig.
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'Eomes'),('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'Eomes')

3 A), (b) the kinetics of Eomes expression paralleled those of perforin expression (Fig.
('Eomes', 'Transcription', 'perforin'),('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin')

2), and (c) overexpression of Eo-VP16 in either WT or T-bet-deficient T cells led to an increase in both perforin and IFN-gamma expression (Fig.
('Eo-VP16', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin')

Specifically, we asked whether Runx3, which was necessary for Eomes induction, then cooperated with Eomes to regulate transcription of the effector CTL markers perforin, IFN-gamma, and granzyme B.
('Eomes', 'Transcription', 'IFN-gamma'),('Eomes', 'Transcription', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'granzyme B'),('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'Eomes'),('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'Eomes'),('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'granzyme B'),('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'granzyme B'),('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'perforin'),('Eomes', 'Transcription', 'granzyme B')

To test this hypothesis, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays to ask whether Eomes and Runx3 bound regulatory regions of the Prf1, Ifng, and Gzmb genes (Fig.
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'Eomes'),('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'Eomes')

Runx3 bound to the Prf1 and Gzmb transcription start sites (TSS); to a known IL-2 responsive enhancer located near -1 kb of the Prf1 gene (23); to the distal CTL-specific DNase I hypersensitive site 9 in the Prf1 locus (24); to the Ifng promoter near the TSS, as previously reported for Th1 cells (10); and to several DNase I hypersensitive sites in the Ifng locus (Fig.
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2')

To determine whether Runx3 controlled the expression of CTL effector genes through its induction of Eomes, we retrovirally expressed Runx3 and Eo-VP16 in CD8+ T cells from Runx3-/- mice.
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'Eomes'),('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'Eomes')

Reconstitution of Runx3-/- CD8+ T cells with Runx3 restored expression of Eomes as well as perforin, granzyme B, and IFN-gamma (Fig.
('Eomes', 'Transcription', 'IFN-gamma'),('Eomes', 'Transcription', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'granzyme B'),('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'Eomes'),('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'Eomes'),('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'granzyme B'),('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'granzyme B'),('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'perforin'),('Eomes', 'Transcription', 'granzyme B')

Notably, Eo-VP16 did not up-regulate perforin expression when expressed in Runx3-/- cells, even though it restored the capacity to induce IFN-gamma expression upon TCR restimulation (Fig.
('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'IFN-gamma'),('Eo-VP16', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'perforin')

This result suggests strongly that perforin expression requires Runx3 and Eomes.
('Eomes', 'Transcription', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'Eomes'),('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'Eomes'),('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'perforin')

As expected from their defect in perforin and granzyme B expression, Runx3-/- CD8+ T cells showed defective cytolytic activity in a mixed lymphocyte reaction (12).
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'granzyme B'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'granzyme B'),('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'perforin')

Therefore, although activation of the perforin/granzyme B machinery is defective in Runx3-/- CD8+ cells, these cells are not entirely devoid of cytolytic activity and could still effectively kill targets, possibly by alternative mechanisms such as the Fas-Fas ligand pathway.

The Effect of Corticosteroids on GATA-3 Nuclear Translocation and IL-4 mRNA
('GATA-3', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-4')

Corticosteroids are effective in inhibiting GATA-3-regulated IL-4 gene expression in vitro and in vivo [32].
('GATA-3', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-4')

This effect was concentration- and time-dependent, with a peak effect of 11.6-fold at 30 min at a concentration of 10-8 M (Figure 1C) and was associated with marked reductions in anti-CD3/CD28-stimulated IL-4 and IL-5 mRNA expression (Figure 1D) and a loss of GATA-3 binding to the native IL-5 promoter (Figure 1E).
('GATA-3', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-4')

Transcription factor GATA-3 is differentially expressed in murine Th1 and Th2 cells and controls Th2-specific expression of the interleukin-5 gene.
('GATA-3', 'Gene_expression', 'interleukin-5')

We previously established a critical role for the transcription factor GATA-3 in IL-5 promoter activation in EL-4 cells, which express both Th1- and Th2-type cytokines.
('GATA-3', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-5'),('GATA-3', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-5')

Our studies reported here demonstrate that GATA-3 is critical for expression of the IL-5 gene in bona fide Th2 cells.
('GATA-3', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-5'),('GATA-3', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-5')

Whereas mutations in the GATA-3 site abolished antigen- or cAMP- stimulated IL-5 promoter activation in Th2 cells, ectopic expression of GATA-3 in Th1 cells or in a non-lymphoid, non-IL-5-producing cell line activated the IL-5 promoter.

To address the mechanisms regulating IL-10 production by Th1 cells in vivo, we transferred DO11.10 cells into BALB/c recipient mice and immunized the recipients with very high doses of OVA-protein with or without added lipopolysacharide (LPS).
('OVA', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

This in vivo immunization induced IL-10 and IFN-gamma production, and the amount of IL-10 production was enhanced by addition of LPS in the immunization (Figure 3A) and with higher doses of OVA (3 muM versus 1 muM, data not shown).
('OVA', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

To test the role of STAT4 and STAT6 signaling in the in vivo development of IL-10-producing Th1 cells, we transferred STAT4- or STAT6-deficient or WT DO11.10 cells into recipient BALB/c mice and immunized with OVA-protein plus LPS as before.

I kappa B/MAD-3 masks the nuclear localization signal of NF-kappa B p65 and requires the transactivation domain to inhibit NF-kappa B p65 DNA binding.
('MAD-3', 'Localization', 'p65'),('MAD-3', 'Binding', 'p65'),('p65', 'Localization', 'p65'),('p65', 'Binding', 'p65')

To investigate the molecular basis for the critical regulatory interaction between NF-kappa B and I kappa B/MAD-3, a series of human NF-kappa B p65 mutants was identified that functionally segregated DNA binding, I kappa B-mediated inhibition, and I kappa B-induced nuclear exclusion of this transcription factor.
('MAD-3', 'Localization', 'p65'),('MAD-3', 'Binding', 'p65')

Results from in vivo expression studies performed with these NF-kappa B p65 mutants revealed the following: 1) I kappa B/MAD-3 completely inhibits NF-kappa B p65-dependent transcriptional activation mediated through the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 kappa B enhancer in human T lymphocytes, 2) the binding of I kappa B/MAD-3 to NF-kappa B p65 is sufficient to retarget NF-kappa B p65 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, 3) selective deletion of the functional nuclear localization signal present in the Rel homology domain of NF-kappa B p65 disrupts its ability to engage I kappa B/MAD-3, and 4) the unique C-terminus of NF-kappa B p65 attenuates its own nuclear localization and contains sequences that are required for I kappa B-mediated inhibition of NF-kappa B p65 DNA binding activity.
('MAD-3', 'Localization', 'p65'),('MAD-3', 'Binding', 'p65'),('p65', 'Localization', 'p65'),('p65', 'Binding', 'p65')

Together, these findings suggest that the nuclear localization signal and transactivation domain of NF-kappa B p65 constitute a bipartite system that is critically involved in the inhibitory function of I kappa B/MAD-3.
('MAD-3', 'Localization', 'p65'),('MAD-3', 'Binding', 'p65')

Unexpectedly, our in vivo studies also demonstrate that I kappa B/MAD-3 binds directly to NF-kappa B p50.

T-bet is induced quickly upon TCR stimulation and is required for early programming of cytokine production (17), whereas Eomes is induced later during differentiation and sustains IFN-gamma expression.
('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma')

Runx3 is required for Eomes and perforin expression, and both Eomes and Runx3 bind at thePrf1locus; in contrast, perforin expression is unaffected in T-bet-deficient cells.
('Eomes', 'Transcription', 'Prf1'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'Eomes'),('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin')

T cells lacking Runx3 show decreased expression of IFN-gamma and granzyme B, and Runx3 also binds the promoter regions of theIfngandGzmbgenes.
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'granzyme B'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'Gzmb')

Collectively, these results provide evidence for a complex transcriptional network in which Runx3 is a primary regulator ofGzmbexpression but synergizes with T-bet and Eomes, respectively, to promote transcription of theIfngandPrf1genes.

The nuclear pool of I(kappa)B(alpha) showed a higher stability than cytosolic I(kappa)B(alpha) and was partially independent of the resynthesis of the protein.
('I(kappa)B(alpha)', 'Gene_expression', 'I(kappa)B(alpha)')

Unexpectedly, the presence of nuclear I(kappa)B(alpha) did not inhibit NF-kappaB binding to DNA and this phenomenon was not due to the presence of IkappaBbeta at the nuclear level.
('IkappaBbeta', 'Localization', 'I(kappa)B(alpha)')

We propose that the activation of an NFAT kinase by PDTC could be responsible for the rapid shuttling of the NFAT, therefore transiently converting the sustained transactivation of this transcription factor that occurs during lymphocyte activation, and show that c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) can act by directly phosphorylating NFATp.

Although GM-CSF does not appear to be essential for normal hemopoiesis, overexpression of GM-CSF has been implicated in the pathogenesis of some diseases such as myeloid leukemia and chronic inflammation.

Role of Egr-2 in up-regulation of Fas ligand in normal T cells and aberrant double-negative lpr and gld T cells.
('Egr-2', 'Positive_regulation', 'Fas ligand')

We previously identified a Fas ligand regulatory element (FLRE) in the Fas ligand (fasL) promoter that binds Egr family proteins and demonstrated that Egr-3 (PILOT) but not Egr-1 (NGFI-A, Krox-24, Tis-8, and Zif-268) induces transcription of fasL.
('PILOT', 'Transcription', 'fasL'),('Egr-1', 'Transcription', 'fasL')

Although overexpressed Egr-1 was ineffective, overexpressed Egr-2 was as potent as Egr-3 in inducing fasL promoter-dependent reporter constructs in T cell hybridomas and HeLa cells, and both up-regulated endogenous fasL mRNA in HeLa cells.
('Egr-1', 'Transcription', 'fasL')

Thus, Egr-2, in addition to Egr-3, regulates FasL expression in activated normal T cells, and Egr-2 is likely to play a direct role in aberrant fasL up-regulation in lpr/lpr and gld/gld CD4(-)CD8(-) T cells.

By increasing GATA-1 levels via co-transfection, we were able to transactivate the hEpoR promoter in K562 cells and non-erythroid cells, but not in the highly active OCIM1 cells, although GATA-1 mRNA levels were comparable in OCIM1 and K562.
('GATA-1', 'Gene_expression', 'hEpoR'),('GATA-1', 'Positive_regulation', 'hEpoR')

Interestingly, when we mutated the Sp1 site, resulting in a marked decrease in hEpoR promoter activity, we could restore transactivation by increasing GATA-1 levels in OCIM1 cells.
('GATA-1', 'Gene_expression', 'hEpoR'),('GATA-1', 'Positive_regulation', 'hEpoR')

These data suggest that while GATA-1 can transactivate the EpoR promoter, the level of hEpoR gene expression does not depend on GATA-1 alone.
('GATA-1', 'Gene_expression', 'hEpoR'),('GATA-1', 'Positive_regulation', 'hEpoR')

Rather, hEpoR transcription activity depends on coordination between Sp1 and GATA-1 with other cell-specific factors, including possibly other Sp1-like binding proteins, to provide high level, tissue-specific expression.

3.5 microg of the FOXP3 promoter luciferase reporter vector or a combination together with the RUNX1, RUNX3 pEGFPN1 vector, and 0.5 microg phRL-TK were added to 3 x 106 CD4+ T cells resuspended in 100 microl of Nucleofector solution (Lonza) and electroporated using the program U-15.

To understand the function of AML1 during B cell differentiation, we analyzed regulatory regions of B cell-specific genes for potential AML1-binding sites and have identified a putative AML1-binding site in the promoter of the B cell-specific tyrosine kinase gene, blk.
('AML1', 'Regulation', 'blk'),('AML1', 'Transcription', 'blk')

Gel mobility shift assays and transient transfection assays demonstrate that AML1 binds specifically to this site in the blk promoter and this binding site is important for blk promoter activity.

BSAP has been shown previously to be important for B cell-specific regulation of the blk gene.

In gene transfection assays, the effect of TNFalpha requires the presence of an inducible nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) (Rel A) binding site in the IL-8 promoter.
('TNFalpha', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-8'),('TNFalpha', 'Transcription', 'IL-8'),('TNFalpha', 'Localization', 'Rel A')

TNFalpha treatment induces a rapid translocation of the 65 kD transcriptional activator NF-kappaB subunit, Rel A, whose binding in the nucleus occurs before changes in intracellular ROS.
('TNFalpha', 'Localization', 'Rel A')

Here we show that in E29.1 T cell hybridoma I kappa B alpha and I kappa B beta are equally associated with p65 and that I kappa B beta is degraded in response to TNF alpha in contrast to what has been originally published.
('TNF alpha', 'Protein_catabolism', 'I kappa B beta')

A kappa B-site was identified in the promoter of the intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) gene, which is involved in regulation of ICAM-1 expression by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and glucocorticoids.
('TNF-alpha', 'Gene_expression', 'ICAM-1'),('TNF-alpha', 'Transcription', 'ICAM-1')

In monocytic THP-1 cells TNF-alpha induced two nuclear complexes which in vitro bound to the ICAM-1 kappa B site.
('TNF-alpha', 'Gene_expression', 'ICAM-1'),('TNF-alpha', 'Transcription', 'ICAM-1')

We argue that in vivo RelA homodimers are likely to play a dominant role in TNF-alpha-induced ICAM-1 transcription in monocytic cells.

Model of MIP-1alpha transcriptional activation by HIV-1 Tat.
('Tat', 'Transcription', 'MIP-1alpha'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'MIP-1alpha'),('Tat', 'Gene_expression', 'MIP-1alpha')

(A) In absence of Tat, IkappaB-alpha occupies the NF-kappaB enhancer of the MIP-1alpha promoter and likely interacts with transcriptional repressors, such as HDACs (65), to inhibit gene transcription.
('Tat', 'Transcription', 'MIP-1alpha'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'MIP-1alpha'),('Tat', 'Gene_expression', 'MIP-1alpha')

(B) Tat activates the MIP-1alpha expression by removing the IkappaB-alpha repressor from the NF-kappaB enhancer, and by increasing the binding of p65 NF-kappaB complex to the NF-kappaB enhancer.
('Tat', 'Transcription', 'MIP-1alpha'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'MIP-1alpha'),('Tat', 'Gene_expression', 'MIP-1alpha')

To investigate the inhibitory mechanisms, we constructed a secreted-type placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP) reporter gene whose transcription is controlled by a 1.4-kb human TNF-alpha promoter.

The functional interaction between Foxp3 and CREB did not affect the DNA-binding activity of CREB-1, but did show a modest decrease in activating transcription factor 2 (ATF-2) DNA-binding activity in the presence of forskolin as determined by transcription factor ELISA (Figure 7B).
('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'activating transcription factor 2'),('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'CREB-1')

To determine whether Foxp3 can disrupt the function/recruitment of the coactivator protein p300, we introduced a Gal4 reporter vector and a Gal4-BD-CREB-1 expression vector into HEK 293T cells in the absence or presence of Foxp3, p300, and/or control expression vectors (Figure 7C).
('p300', 'Transcription', 'Gal4-BD-CREB-1'),('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'CREB-1'),('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'p300'),('p300', 'Binding', 'p300'),('Foxp3', 'Positive_regulation', 'Gal4-BD-CREB-1')

As expected, p300 overexpression stimulated transcription of the Gal4-BD-CREB-1 fusion protein.
('p300', 'Transcription', 'Gal4-BD-CREB-1')

Foxp3, again, repressed basal levels of Gal4-BD-CREB-1 activation by more than 2-fold, while effectively neutralizing Gal4-BD-CREB-1 activation in the presence of p300.
('p300', 'Transcription', 'Gal4-BD-CREB-1'),('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'CREB-1'),('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'p300'),('Foxp3', 'Positive_regulation', 'Gal4-BD-CREB-1')

Overexpression of Foxp3 failed to reduce the detectable levels of CREB phosphorylation using a phosphospecific antibody for CREB-1 (unpublished data).
('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'CREB-1')

However, when we attempted to determine whether Foxp3 could physically interact with the coactivator protein p300, we found that p300 immunoprecipitated Foxp3 when both proteins were overexpressed in HEK 293T cells (Figure 7D).
('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'p300'),('p300', 'Binding', 'p300')

Collectively, these results suggest that Foxp3 antagonizes CREB-dependent gene expression by directly interacting with coactivator p300 and interfering with its function and/or recruitment to CREB-responsive promoter sequences.
('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'p300')

LMP1 Upregulates IL10 and Constitutively Activates Stat3
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL10'),('IL10', 'Positive_regulation', 'Stat3')

Transcription of IL10, IL15, and IFNgamma were reproducibly detected in LMP1 transgenic lymphocytes and lymphoma cells and was higher than in the B cell lymphoma cell lines 967 and K46mu (Figure 5A).
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL10'),('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'IFNgamma'),('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL15')

There was no significant difference in the expression of IL15 and IFNgamma between LMP1 transgenic lymphocytes and lymphoma cells, suggesting that upregulation of IL15 and IFNgamma is induced by LMP1 expression in healthy lymphocytes but is not a unique property of malignant lymphocytes.
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'IFNgamma'),('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL15')

Strikingly, IL10, a B lymphocyte stimulatory cytokine, was increased 1.5- to 5-fold in the wild-type and LMP1 transgenic lymphoma cells compared to LMP1 transgenic lymphocytes (Figure 5A).
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL10')

Immunoblot analysis indicated that LMP1 transgenic lymphocytes and wild-type and LMP1 transgenic lymphoma cells had corresponding increased levels of phosphorylated alpha and beta isoforms of activated Stat3, a target of the IL10 receptor (Figure 5B).
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL10'),('IL10', 'Positive_regulation', 'Stat3')

However, when comparing the same lymphomas, there was no correlation between the levels of IL10 induction and the levels of Stat3 activation.
('IL10', 'Positive_regulation', 'Stat3')

This suggests that the activation of Stat3 is not solely induced by IL10 or that Stat3 activation may be constitutive.
('IL10', 'Positive_regulation', 'Stat3')

Additionally, there was no correlation between the levels of LMP1 expression and the levels of IL10 induction (Figures 1A and 5A).
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL10')

This indicates that the induction of IL10 is a general property associated with enhanced survival and may only be indirectly affected by LMP1.
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL10')

Neutralizing antibodies to IL10 did not affect the survival of lymphoma cells as determined by the MTS assay (unpublished data), suggesting constitutive activation of Stat3.
('IL10', 'Positive_regulation', 'Stat3')

This was confirmed by immunoblot analysis such that in the presence of anti-IL10 neutralizing antibodies, pStat3 levels remained activated in lymphoma cells isolated from wild-type and LMP1 transgenic lymphomas (Figure 5C).
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL10'),('IL10', 'Positive_regulation', 'pStat3'),('IL10', 'Positive_regulation', 'Stat3')

Exogenous addition of IL10 enhanced pStat3 activation above constitutive levels, indicating that lymphoma cells are responsive to IL10 treatment (Figure 5C).
('IL10', 'Positive_regulation', 'pStat3'),('IL10', 'Positive_regulation', 'Stat3')

This means that although the lymphoma cells have constitutive Stat3 activation, it may be further enhanced by IL10 induction.
('IL10', 'Positive_regulation', 'Stat3')

Nuclear translocation of pStat3 is a consequence of activation, and nuclear pStat3 was not detected by immunohistochemistry staining of spleen sections from control mice.

Retinoblastoma protein expression leads to reduced Oct-1 DNA binding activity and enhances interleukin-8 expression.
('Retinoblastoma', 'Gene_expression', 'interleukin-8'),('Retinoblastoma', 'Binding', 'Oct-1')

Oct-1, a POU domain transcription factor, was identified as a repressor of HLA-DRA promoter activity in the Rb-defective cells.
('Rb', 'Phosphorylation', 'Oct-1')

Rb expression led to phosphorylation of Oct-1, thus relieving its repressive effect.
('Rb', 'Phosphorylation', 'Oct-1')

Consistent with reduced levels of Oct-1 DNA binding activity in the Rb-transformed cell lines, interleukin 8 expression is higher in these cell lines.
('Rb', 'Phosphorylation', 'Oct-1')

Two allelic, autosomal recessive mutations in the Sharpin gene occurred spontaneously in two inbred strains of mice, C57B/KaLawRij-Sharpincpdm/Sharpincpdm and CBy.Ocb3/Dem-Sharpincpdm-Dem/Sharpincpdm-Dem, resulting in premature termination of mRNA synthesis and absence of a functional protein product [2].
('Sharpin', 'Negative_regulation', 'Sharpin')

There are accumulations of eosinophils, neutrophils and macrophages in the skin of Sharpincpdm/Sharpincpdm mutant mice (hereafter referred to as cpdm mice) associated with increased expression of Th2 cytokines in the skin and in the supernatants of activated splenocytes [5].
('Sharpin', 'Negative_regulation', 'Sharpin')

A low amount of transcription of Ifngamma was induced by IL-12 when cells were differentiated with low antigen dose, but this effect of IL-12 was markedly upregulated with increasing doses of antigen (Figure 6A).
('IL-12', 'Transcription', 'Ifngamma'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'Ifngamma')

However, IL-12 induced a high amount of Il10 transcription as well as Ifngamma expression with increased antigen doses (Figure 6A), again in keeping with the protein data (Figure 1A).
('IL-12', 'Transcription', 'Ifngamma'),('IL-12', 'Transcription', 'Il10'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'Ifngamma')

In contrast, high amounts of GATA-3 mRNA expression were only observed under Th2 cell differentiation conditions (low-dose antigen) (Figure 6B), and this expression was markedly downregulated by both increasing antigen dose and coculture in IL-12 (Figure 6B).
('IL-12', 'Transcription', 'GATA-3')

Interestingly, IL-12 sustained the high expression of c-Maf mRNA even at the highest antigen dose (Figure 6B).
('IL-12', 'Transcription', 'c-Maf')

Moreover, IL-12 maintenance of c-maf expression required STAT4 activation (data not shown).
('c-maf', 'Positive_regulation', 'STAT4'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'c-maf')

We showed also that like Il10 expression, c-maf expression was inhibited in Th1 and Th17 cells in the presence of the MEK1 and MEK2 inhibitor (PD184352), whereas T-bet and RORgammat expression was hardly affected (Figure 6D).

Effect of IL-4 on FOXP3 Induction

(D) Intracellular GATA3 and FOXP3 staining are shown after exposure of CD4+CD45RA+ T cells to IL-4 as described for panel B.

In contrast, protein kinase C stimulation or RelA overexpression does not affect the activity of a human IL4 promoter containing a mouse P sequence, which is a higher-affinity site for NF-ATp and a lower-affinity site for RelA.
('RelA', 'Binding', 'NF-ATp'),('NF-ATp', 'Binding', 'RelA')

Thus, competition between two general transcriptional activators, RelA and NF-ATp, mediates the inhibitory effect of protein kinase C stimulation on IL4 expression and may contribute to differential gene expression in TH cells.

Regulation of FOXP3 promoter activity and FOXP3 protein expression by RUNX1 and RUNX3
('RUNX3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

To investigate the effect of RUNX1 and RUNX3 binding to the RUNX binding sites in the FOXP3 promoter, we transfected human peripheral blood CD4+ T cells with a FOXP3 promoter luciferase reporter vector and RUNX1 or RUNX3 expression vectors.
('RUNX3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

An increase in luciferase activity was observed only when the FOXP3 promoter (-511 to +176) luciferase construct was cotransfected with RUNX1 or RUNX3 expression vectors (Fig.
('RUNX3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

In these experiments, the overexpression of RUNX1 and RUNX3 eliminated the need of TGF-beta for FOXP3 promoter activation and PMA/ionomycin stimulation was sufficient.
('RUNX3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

To examine the role of each of the three RUNX binding sites for the FOXP3 promoter activity, we mutated each individually or in combination.
('RUNX', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

4 B), suggesting that the identified binding sites have redundant functions and RUNX binding to more than one site is necessary for the full activation of the FOXP3 promoter.
('RUNX', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

Supporting these findings, the overexpression of RUNX1 in human primary CD4+ T cells resulted in significantly elevated levels of FOXP3 protein measured by flow cytometry after 48 h. This was achieved without any requirement for anti-CD3, anti-CD28 stimulation, or the presence of TGF-beta.
('RUNX1', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

Although there was a trend, the transfection of CD4+ T cells with RUNX3 did not lead to statistically significant increase in FOXP3 (Fig.
('RUNX3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

Perforin and granzyme B expression are not appreciably regulated by T-bet
('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'granzyme B'),('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'Perforin')

To test the model outlined in the previous paragraph directly, we compared the expression of IFN-gamma, perforin, and granzyme B in CD8+ T cells from WT and Tbx21 (T-bet)-deficient mice.
('T-bet', 'Transcription', 'perforin'),('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'granzyme B'),('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma')

In contrast, T-bet-deficient T cells cultured for 6 d showed no defect in perforin mRNA expression (Fig.
('T-bet', 'Transcription', 'perforin')

We consistently observed a modest reduction in GzmB mRNA in T-bet-deficient T cells (Fig.
('T-bet', 'Transcription', 'GzmB'),('T-bet', 'Negative_regulation', 'GzmB')

Eo-VP16, but not the empty GFP retrovirus, increased perforin expression in both WT and T-bet-deficient CD8+ T cells (Fig.
('T-bet', 'Transcription', 'perforin'),('Eo-VP16', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin')

As expected, Eo-VP16 also rescued the early defect in IFN-gamma production observed in T-bet-deficient CD8+ T cells (Fig.
('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma')

However, Eo-VP16 did not induce GzmB mRNA expression in either WT or T-bet-deficient cells; thus, the partial T-bet dependence of GzmB mRNA expression cannot be compensated for by Eo-VP16.
('T-bet', 'Transcription', 'GzmB'),('Eo-VP16', 'Transcription', 'GzmB'),('T-bet', 'Negative_regulation', 'GzmB')

Mutation of the NF-kappaB site did not affect IL-2 expression, whereas mutation of the AP-1 site or PKC depletion almost revoked IL-2 release.
('IL-2', 'Localization', 'IL-2'),('IL-2', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2')

The KBF1 factor, which binds to the enhancer A located in the promoter of the mouse MHC class I gene H-2Kb, is indistinguishable from the p50 DNA binding subunit of the transcription factor NF-kappa B, which regulates a series of genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses.
('p50', 'Binding', 'KBF1')

The KBF1/p50 factor binds as a homodimer but can also form heterodimers with the products of other members of the same family, like the c-rel and v-rel (proto)oncogenes.
('p50', 'Binding', 'c-'),('p50', 'Binding', 'KBF1'),('p50', 'Binding', 'v-rel')

The dimerization domain of KBF1/p50 is contained between amino acids 201 and 367.
('p50', 'Binding', 'KBF1')

A mutant of KBF1/p50 (delta SP), unable to bind to DNA but able to form homo- or heterodimers, has been constructed.
('p50', 'Binding', 'KBF1')

This protein reduces or abolishes in vitro the DNA binding activity of wild-type proteins of the same family (KBF1/p50, c- and v-rel).

Evidence for suppressed activity of the transcription factor NFAT1 at its proximal binding element P0 in the IL-4 promoter associated with enhanced IL-4 gene transcription in T cells of atopic patients.
('NFAT1', 'Regulation', 'IL-4')

Allergen-specific T cells in atopic patients are polarized IL-4-producing Th2 cells, promoting IgE synthesis by B cells.
('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'IgE')

IL-4 gene regulation in general involves the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) family of transcription factors, of which NFAT1 and NFAT2 are most prominent in peripheral T cells.
('NFAT2', 'Regulation', 'IL-4'),('NFAT1', 'Regulation', 'IL-4')

Recently, a unique inhibitory role of NFAT1 in IL-4 gene control was shown in the mouse.
('NFAT1', 'Regulation', 'IL-4')

These findings suggest that high-level IL-4 production in atopic Th2 cells is associated with selective reduction of suppressive NFAT1 activity at the IL-4 P0 element and that some patients with this multifactorial disease may have a putative systemic disorder at this level.
('NFAT1', 'Regulation', 'IL-4')

To circumvent this problem, we developed an alternative procedure which allowed us to show that in neutrophils, LPS and TNFalpha induce a NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity which essentially consists of p50/RelA dimers, and that IFNgamma promotes the binding of STAT1 homodimers to the IFNgamma response region of the FcgammaRI promoter.
('IFNgamma', 'Binding', 'STAT1')

GATA-1 and erythropoietin cooperate to promote erythroid cell survival by regulating bcl-xL expression.
('GATA-1', 'Gene_expression', 'bcl-xL'),('erythropoietin', 'Gene_expression', 'bcl-xL')

Here we report that in erythroid cells, GATA-1 strongly induces the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein bcl-xL, but not the related proteins bcl-2 and mcl-1.
('GATA-1', 'Gene_expression', 'bcl-2'),('GATA-1', 'Gene_expression', 'mcl-1'),('GATA-1', 'Gene_expression', 'bcl-xL')

Consistent with a role for bcl-xL in mediating GATA-1-induced erythroid cell survival, in vitro-differentiated bcl-xL-/- embryonic stem cells fail to generate viable mature definitive erythroid cells, a phenotype resembling that of GATA-1 gene disruption.
('GATA-1', 'Gene_expression', 'bcl-xL')

In addition, we show that erythropoietin, which is also required for erythroid cell survival, cooperates with GATA-1 to stimulate bcl-xL gene expression and to maintain erythroid cell viability during terminal maturation.
('GATA-1', 'Gene_expression', 'bcl-xL'),('erythropoietin', 'Gene_expression', 'bcl-xL')

Together, our data show that bcl-xL is essential for normal erythroid development and suggest a regulatory hierarchy in which bcl-xL is a critical downstream effector of GATA-1 and erythropoietin-mediated signals.
('GATA-1', 'Gene_expression', 'bcl-xL'),('erythropoietin', 'Gene_expression', 'bcl-xL')

Cross-linking CD19 on early human B lineage cells induces the formation of a CD19/Vav/phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase complex, tyrosine phosphorylation of CD19 and Vav, and activation of the Ras pathway.
('CD19', 'Binding', 'CD19'),('CD19', 'Phosphorylation', 'CD19')

To further explore the ramifications of CD19 signaling, the current study examined whether phosphorylation of Elk-1, activation of activator protein-1 (AP-1), or activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) transcription factors occurred following CD19 cross-linking.

The present study demonstrates that tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced degradation of I kappa B alpha in human T cells is preceded by its rapid phosphorylation in vivo.
('tumor necrosis factor alpha', 'Protein_catabolism', 'I kappa B alpha')

Subsequent studies have revealed that (i) cytoplasmic RelA is stably associated not only with I kappa B alpha but also with other ankyrin motif-rich proteins including the products of the NF-kappa B2 (p100) and NF-kappa B1 (p105) genes; (ii) in contrast to RelA-I kappa B alpha, RelA-p100 cytoplasmic complexes are not dissociated following tumor necrosis factor alpha activation; (iii) p100 functions as a potent inhibitor of RelA-mediated transcription in vivo; (iv) the interaction of RelA and p100 involves the conserved Rel homology domain of both proteins but not the nuclear localization signal of RelA, which is required for I kappa B alpha binding; (v) p100 inhibition of RelA function requires the C-terminal ankyrin motif domain, which mediates cytoplasmic retention of RelA; and (vi) as observed with I kappa B alpha, nuclear RelA stimulates p100 mRNA and protein expression.

The participation of STAT4 in the regulation of IRF-1 was demonstrated in two ways.

First, STAT4 was required for the IL-12-dependent transactivation of an IRF-1 reporter construct, and second, STAT4 binding to the IRF-1 promoter was shown using EMSA.
('STAT4', 'Regulation', 'IRF-1')

In contrast to IL-12, no up-regulation of IRF-1 was found in IL-4-stimulated cells, and IL-4 did not block IL-12-dependent up-regulation of IRF-1.
('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'IRF-1')

Stat3gamma is derived from Stat3alpha by limited proteolysis and lacks the carboxyl-terminal portion of Stat3alpha.
('Stat3alpha', 'Positive_regulation', 'Stat3gamma')

Because this region of Stat3alpha is involved in transcriptional activation, our findings suggest the possibility that Stat3gamma may be transcriptionally inactive and may compete with Stat3alpha for Stat3 binding sites in these terminally differentiated myeloid cells.

Treatment of T cells with the selective PKC inhibitor GF109203X abrogates the PMA-induced IkB alpha phosphorylation/degradation irrespective of activation of Ca(2+)-dependent pathways, but not the phosphorylation and degradation of IkB alpha induced by TNF-alpha, a PKC-independent stimulus.
('TNF-alpha', 'Phosphorylation', 'IkB alpha'),('TNF-alpha', 'Protein_catabolism', 'IkB alpha')

Triggering of complement receptors CR1 (CD35) and CR3 (CD11b/CD18) induces nuclear translocation of NF-kappa B (p50/p65) in human monocytes and enhances viral replication in HIV-infected monocytic cells.

The effect of LPS and TNF-alpha is mediated by their ability to induce nuclear translocation of the DNA-binding heterodimer NF-kappa B (p50/p65), which binds to a specific sequence in the HIV-long terminal repeat.

We further observed that stimulation of CR1 or CR3 induces the nuclear translocation of NF-kappa B p50/p65 in infected cells.
('CR1', 'Localization', 'p50'),('CR1', 'Localization', 'p65')

Uncoupling activation-dependent HS1 phosphorylation from nuclear factor of activated T cells transcriptional activation in Jurkat T cells: differential signaling through CD3 and the costimulatory receptors CD2 and CD28.
('CD2', 'Phosphorylation', 'HS1'),('CD28', 'Phosphorylation', 'HS1')

We have examined changes in HS1 phosphorylation after differential stimulation of CD3, CD2, and CD28 to elucidate its role in T cells and to further delineate the signaling pathways recruited by these receptors.
('CD2', 'Phosphorylation', 'HS1'),('CD28', 'Phosphorylation', 'HS1')

Unlike ligation of CD3, stimulation with anti-CD28 mAb or CHO cells expressing the CD28 ligands CD80 or CD86 did not lead to tyrosine phosphorylation of HS1 in Jurkat T cells.
('CD2', 'Phosphorylation', 'HS1'),('CD28', 'Phosphorylation', 'HS1')

Additionally, no tyrosine phosphorylation of HS1 was induced by mitogenic pairs of anti-CD2 mAbs capable of activating the transcription factor NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells).
('CD2', 'Phosphorylation', 'HS1')

Costimulation through CD28 and/or CD2 did not modulate the CD3-dependent phosphorylation of HS1.
('CD2', 'Phosphorylation', 'HS1'),('CD28', 'Phosphorylation', 'HS1')

Thus, although CD3, CD28, and CD2 activate many of the same signaling molecules, they differed in their capacity to induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of HSI.

During Epstein-Barr virus latent infection of B lymphocytes in vitro, six viral nuclear antigens (EBNAs) are expressed from one of two promoters, Cp or Wp, whose activities are mutually exclusive.
('Cp', 'Positive_regulation', 'Wp')

Upon infection, Wp is initially active, followed by a switch to Cp for the duration of latency.
('Cp', 'Positive_regulation', 'Wp')

It was determined that oriP, the origin for episomal maintenance during latency, is essential for efficient transcription initiation from either Cp or Wp in LCLs, as well as in some Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines.
('Cp', 'Positive_regulation', 'Wp')

In general, deletions which diminished Cp activity resulted in induction of Wp activity, consistent with suppression of Wp activity by transcriptional interference from Cp.
('Cp', 'Positive_regulation', 'Wp')

Furthermore, our studies showed association of the IKK-alpha/beta heterodimer with NIK, IkappaB-alpha and -epsilon in unstimulated cells.
('NIK', 'Phosphorylation', 'IkappaB-alpha')

Exposure to LPS or TNF led to differential patterns of IkappaB-alpha and IkappaB-epsilon disappearance from and reassembly with the signalsome, whereas IKK-alpha, IKK-beta, and NIK remained complex-associated.
('NIK', 'Phosphorylation', 'IkappaB-alpha')

NIK cannot phosphorylate IkappaB-alpha directly, but it appears to be a functionally important subunit, because mutated NIK inhibited stimulus-induced kappaB-dependent transcription more effectively than mutated IKK-alpha or -beta.
('NIK', 'Phosphorylation', 'IkappaB-alpha')

IL-2 gene expression and NF-kappa B activation through CD28 requires reactive oxygen production by 5-lipoxygenase.
('CD28', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2')

Activation of the CD28 surface receptor provides a major costimulatory signal for T cell activation resulting in enhanced production of interleukin-2 (IL-2) and cell proliferation.
('CD28', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2')

In primary T lymphocytes we show that CD28 ligation leads to the rapid intracellular formation of reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs) which are required for CD28-mediated activation of the NF-kappa B/CD28-responsive complex and IL-2 expression.
('CD28', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2')

The small heat shock protein HSP27 has recently been proposed as a PKD1 substrate [24] and we accordingly assessed whether PKD-null DT40 cells have defective phosphorylation of HSP27 on serine 82, the proposed PKD1 substrate sequence.
('PKD1', 'Phosphorylation', 'HSP27')

We initially investigated the regulation of HSP27 phosphorylation in single knockout DT40 B cells lacking either PKD1 or PKD3.
('PKD1', 'Phosphorylation', 'HSP27'),('PKD3', 'Phosphorylation', 'HSP27')

BCR and phorbol ester signals were also able to increase HSP27 phosphorylation in PKD1 or PKD3 single knockout DT40 B cells (Fig.
('PKD1', 'Phosphorylation', 'HSP27'),('PKD3', 'Phosphorylation', 'HSP27')

However, BCR- and phorbol ester-induced phosphorylation of HSP27 on S82 was abolished in B cells that lacked both PKD1 and PKD3 (Fig.
('PKD1', 'Phosphorylation', 'HSP27'),('PKD3', 'Phosphorylation', 'HSP27')

Significantly, doxycycline-induced expression of the Flag-PKD3 transgene in the double knockout cells was sufficient to restore normal regulation of HSP27 phosphorylation (Fig.
('PKD3', 'Phosphorylation', 'HSP27')

In contrast, expression of a kinase-deficient PKD3 mutant protein in the double knockout cells was not able to restore BCR- or phorbol ester-induced HSP27 phosphorylation (Fig.
('PKD3', 'Phosphorylation', 'HSP27')

Hence, PKD3 as well as PKD1 can regulate HSP27 phosphorylation and in DT40 B cells they are functionally redundant as HSP27 kinases.
('PKD1', 'Phosphorylation', 'HSP27'),('PKD3', 'Phosphorylation', 'HSP27')

A dimerization cofactor of HNF-1 alpha (DCoH) was identified that displayed a restricted tissue distribution and did not bind to DNA, but, rather, selectively stabilized HNF-1 alpha dimers.
('DCoH', 'Binding', 'HNF-1 alpha')

The formation of a stable tetrameric DCoH-HNF-1 alpha complex, which required the dimerization domain of HNF-1 alpha, did not change the DNA binding characteristics of HNF-1 alpha, but enhanced its transcriptional activity.
('DCoH', 'Binding', 'HNF-1 alpha')

IKKbeta is required for RPS3 nuclear translocation
('IKKbeta', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

To examine whether the RPS3-IKKbeta interaction is required for RPS3 nuclear translocation, we knocked down IKKalpha or IKKbeta expression with siRNAs (Supplementary Fig.
('IKKbeta', 'Localization', 'RPS3'),('RPS3', 'Localization', 'RPS3'),('IKKalpha', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

RPS3 nuclear translocation was only slightly, if at all, impaired by IKKalpha-silencing.
('IKKalpha', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

Conversely, knockdown of IKKbeta attenuated 60-70% of RPS3 nuclear accumulation following stimulation (Fig.
('IKKbeta', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

Immunoblotting of nuclear fractions confirmed that full expression of IKKbeta, but not IKKalpha, was necessary for activation-induced RPS3 nuclear translocation (Fig.
('IKKbeta', 'Localization', 'RPS3'),('IKKalpha', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

We next examined the nuclear translocation of RPS3 in cells ectopically expressing either kinase-dead (SSAA) or constitutively-active (SSEE) mutant IKKbeta proteins.
('IKKbeta', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

As expected, the SSEE, but not SSAA, mutant of IKKbeta induced NF-kappaB-dependent luciferase reporter activity (Fig.
('IKKbeta', 'Regulation', 'luciferase')

Whereas RPS3 remained cytosolic in IKKbeta (SSAA)-expressing cells (Fig.
('IKKbeta', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

2c, right), a substantial proportion of RPS3 translocated to the nucleus in cells expressing IKKbeta (SSEE) (Fig.
('IKKbeta', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

The percentage of cells containing detectable nuclear RPS3 increased 5-fold in IKKbeta (SSEE)-expressing cells, but not in IKKbeta (SSAA)-expressing ones (Fig.
('IKKbeta', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

Thus, IKKbeta activity is necessary and sufficient for RPS3 nuclear translocation in response to NF-kappaB activating stimuli.
('IKKbeta', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

In combination, EBF and E47 induce efficient expression of the endogenous immunoglobulin surrogate light chain genes, lambda5 and VpreB, whereas other pre-B cell-specific genes remain silent.
('E47', 'Gene_expression', 'lambda5'),('EBF', 'Gene_expression', 'VpreB'),('E47', 'Gene_expression', 'VpreB'),('EBF', 'Gene_expression', 'lambda5')

Multiple functionally important EBF and E47 binding sites were identified in the lambda5 promoter/enhancer region, indicating that lambda5 is a direct genetic target for these transcription factors.
('E47', 'Gene_expression', 'lambda5'),('EBF', 'Gene_expression', 'lambda5')

Expression of the IgG Fc receptor type I (Fc gamma RI) on myeloid cells is dramatically increased by treatment with interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma).
('IFN-gamma', 'Transcription', 'Fc gamma RI')

We observed that Fc gamma RI transcript levels in monoblast-like U937 cells were elevated within 3 hr and peaked 12 hr after exposure to IFN-gamma.
('IFN-gamma', 'Transcription', 'Fc gamma RI')

Treatment of U937 with IFN-gamma for 9 hr in the presence of cycloheximide led to super-induction of Fc gamma RI expression.
('IFN-gamma', 'Transcription', 'Fc gamma RI')

Nuclear run-on analysis revealed that the rate of Fc gamma RI transcription was increased by IFN-gamma.
('IFN-gamma', 'Transcription', 'Fc gamma RI')

Transient transfections of CAT reporter gene constructs containing various Fc gamma RIC promoter sequences into U937 cells revealed that a 20-bp region surrounding the transcription start site (-7 to +13) was capable of mediating transcription initiation and that an IFN-gamma responsive element (GIRE) was present within 74 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site.
('IFN-gamma', 'Transcription', 'Fc gamma RI')

Gel shift experiments further showed that the STAT1 alpha protein bound to the Fc gamma RIC GIRE in response to IFN-gamma treatment of U937 cells.
('IFN-gamma', 'Transcription', 'Fc gamma RI'),('STAT1 alpha', 'Regulation', 'Fc gamma RIC')

The Fc gamma RIC GIRE is homologous to the IFN-gamma activation sequence (GAS) of the guanylate binding protein and to X box elements of class II MHC genes.
('IFN-gamma', 'Transcription', 'Fc gamma RI')

Our results demonstrate that transcriptional regulation of the Fc gamma RIC gene by IFN-gamma involves the binding of STAT1 alpha to a 17-bp GAS homology in the proximal promoter.
('IFN-gamma', 'Transcription', 'Fc gamma RI'),('STAT1 alpha', 'Regulation', 'Fc gamma RIC')

Steel factor affects SCL expression during normal erythroid differentiation.
('Steel factor', 'Gene_expression', 'SCL'),('Steel factor', 'Transcription', 'SCL')

Steel factor is one of the growth factors that controls the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic cells and SCL, also known as Tcl-5 or Tal-1, is a transcription factor involved in erythropoiesis.
('Steel factor', 'Gene_expression', 'SCL'),('Steel factor', 'Transcription', 'SCL')

In this report, we studied the role of SCL in the proliferation of human peripheral blood burst-forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E) and the effects of Steel factor on SCL expression in proliferating erythroid cells.
('Steel factor', 'Gene_expression', 'SCL'),('Steel factor', 'Transcription', 'SCL')

The role of SCL in Steel factor-induced erythroid proliferation was then examined.
('Steel factor', 'Gene_expression', 'SCL'),('Steel factor', 'Transcription', 'SCL')

In day 7 and day 10 erythroid precursors cultured with Steel factor, SCL protein was increased significantly compared to control.
('Steel factor', 'Gene_expression', 'SCL'),('Steel factor', 'Transcription', 'SCL')

The increase in SCL protein levels in early erythroid precursors stimulated with Steel factor suggests one mechanism through which Steel factor may enhance normal erythroid proliferation.
('Steel factor', 'Gene_expression', 'SCL'),('Steel factor', 'Transcription', 'SCL')

SCL mRNA levels assessed by Northern blot in day 7 cells did not increase significantly in response to Steel factor stimulation, suggesting that posttranscriptional mechanisms may also be important in the increase in SCL protein observed in response to Steel.
('Steel factor', 'Gene_expression', 'SCL'),('Steel factor', 'Transcription', 'SCL')

In addition, we observed that the A3G promoter was not inducible by IFN-alpha or IFN-gamma in A3.01 T cells, whereas in the hepatic cell line HepG2, a moderate induction was measured.
('IFN-alpha', 'Gene_expression', 'A3G'),('IFN-gamma', 'Gene_expression', 'A3G')

A recent study found no influence of IFN-alpha or IFN-gamma on A3G expression in resting primary blood lymphocytes (52).
('IFN-alpha', 'Gene_expression', 'A3G'),('IFN-gamma', 'Gene_expression', 'A3G')

Another publication describes an enhanced expression of A3G after IFN-alpha treatment in resting primary CD4 T cells, but not in activated T cells (53).
('IFN-alpha', 'Gene_expression', 'A3G')

The HIV-1 Vif protein is neutralizing the antiviral function of A3G by a multitude of ways.
('Vif', 'Protein_catabolism', 'A3G'),('Vif', 'Transcription', 'A3G')

There is evidence that Vif also promotes exclusion of A3G from the virus particles and an influence on the A3G translation process is discussed (8,42,43).
('A3G', 'Binding', 'A3G'),('A3G', 'Transcription', 'A3G'),('Vif', 'Protein_catabolism', 'A3G'),('Vif', 'Transcription', 'A3G')

The question whether Vif alters transcription controlled by the A3G promoter has not been analyzed so far.
('Vif', 'Protein_catabolism', 'A3G'),('Vif', 'Transcription', 'A3G')

Our analysis indicates that transcription from the A3G promoter is unaffected by Vif or other HIV-1 proteins.
('Vif', 'Protein_catabolism', 'A3G'),('Vif', 'Transcription', 'A3G')

This observation is consistent with the results of the 5'-RACE, since Sp1 is known to play an important role for RNA polymerase II to bind to the transcription initiation site in TATA-boxless promoters and is associated with multiple transcription initiation sites (54-56).
('Sp1', 'Binding', 'RNA polymerase II')

Therefore, Sp1/Sp3 transcription factors are most likely also mediating basal transcription of the A3F gene.
('Sp1', 'Transcription', 'A3F'),('Sp3', 'Transcription', 'A3F')

Nuclear factor of activated T cells and AP-1 are insufficient for IL-2 promoter activation: requirement for CD28 up-regulation of RE/AP.
('CD28', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-2')

IL-2 promoter activation in Jurkat T cells stimulated with superantigen presented by Raji B cells requires CD28 activation.
('CD28', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-2')

The addition of rCTLA4Ig, which blocks CD28 binding to its ligand, to the cultures decreased IL-2 promoter activation by >80%.
('CD28', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-2')

Thus, the requirement for CD28 in IL-2 promoter activation appears to be due to RE/AP and not the NFAT or AP-1 sites.
('CD28', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-2')

Thus, c-Fos/c-Jun heterodimers might contribute to the repression of DRA gene expression.

BMP-6 induces phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8
('BMP-6', 'Phosphorylation', 'Smad1'),('BMP-6', 'Phosphorylation', '5'),('BMP-6', 'Phosphorylation', '8')

Interestingly, treatment with 500 ng/ml BMP-6 induced phosphorylation of Smad.
('BMP-6', 'Phosphorylation', '5')

The BMP-6 induced phosphorylation was high at the earliest time point tested (15 minutes), and remained high for at least 48 hours (Figure 5).
('BMP-6', 'Phosphorylation', '5'),('BMP-6', 'Phosphorylation', '8')

However, we did not observe any significant changes in the level of phospho-STAT3 or phospho-p38 upon BMP-6 treatment of B cells (data not shown).

The current study provides evidence that GATA3 and FOXP3 play a competitive role in iTreg cell commitment as T-bet and GATA3 for Th1 and Th2 differentiation, respectively.
('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

We show that GATA3 inhibits FOXP3 induction and that IL-4 limits FOXP3 expression in a GATA3-mediated way, both in vitro and in vivo.
('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

We also show that GATA3 directly binds to the FOXP3 promoter and thereby prevents the induction of this gene, demonstrating that Th2 differentiation overrules iTreg induction.
('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

Stimulation of T cells with BW 828 induced an increase in intracellular Ca2+, but did not lead to detectable activation of the protein kinases p56(lck) and c-Raf-1.
('BW 828', 'Positive_regulation', 'p56(lck)')

On the other hand, stimulation of T cells with mAb 9.3 increased the level of intracellular Ca2+ and triggered the activation of p56(lck) and c-Raf-1, but was unable to induce the binding of transcription factors to the IL-2 promoter.
('9.3', 'Positive_regulation', 'p56(lck)')

In contrast to the differential signaling of BW 828 and 9.3 in resting T cells, the two mAbs exhibited a similar pattern of early signaling events in activated T cells and Jurkat cells (p56(lck) activation, association of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase with CD28), indicating that the signaling capacity of CD28 changes with activation.

Analysis of the accumulation of mRNA-encoding members of the AP-1 transcription factor family demonstrated that c-fos and junB are also expressed upon stimulation of NK and T cells with IL-2, but not IL-12, whereas expression of c-jun and junD is not modified by either cytokine.
('IL-2', 'Gene_expression', 'c-jun'),('IL-2', 'Gene_expression', 'junD')

Analysis of the expression of genes reported to regulate cytokine-induced proliferation demonstrated that both IL-2 and IL-12 induce c-myc mRNA accumulation in NK and T cells, whereas only IL-2 induces bcl-2 expression.
('IL-2', 'Positive_regulation', 'c-myc'),('IL-2', 'Gene_expression', 'bcl-2')

Expression of the human interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor alpha chain gene is potently upregulated by its own ligand, IL-2.
('IL-2', 'Gene_expression', 'interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor alpha chain')

However, it was not possible to ascertain whether Bcl-2 upregulation was a specific consequence of LMP1 expression or an artifact of the selection procedure whereby rare Bcl-2+ cells already present in the starting population might best be able to tolerate the potentially toxic effects of LMP1.
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'Bcl-2')

We therefore reexamined this issue by using two different experimental approaches that allowed LMP1- induced effects to be monitored immediately following expression of the viral protein and in the absence of selective pressures; activation of the NF-kappa B transcription factor and upregulation of the cell adhesion molecule ICAM-1 were used as early indices of LMP1 function.
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'ICAM-1')

All six B-cell lines tested showed NF-kappa B activation in response to LMP1 expression, and this was followed in five of six lines by expression of ICAM-1 and Bcl-2.
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'Bcl-2'),('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'ICAM-1')

We therefore conclude that Bcl-2 upregulation is part of the panoply of cellular changes induced by LMP1 but that the effect is cell type specific.
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'Bcl-2')

Luciferase assays revealed a approximately20-fold increased transcriptional activity of the 1025 bp sequence as compared to the empty vector, indicating that we had identified an active A3G promoter sequence (Figure 3B).

The regulation of interleukin-2 receptor alpha chain (IL-2R alpha) expression and nuclear factor (NF) activation by protein kinase C (PKC) in resting T cells, has been studied.
('IL-2', 'Negative_regulation', 'IL-2R alpha')

Treatment of human resting T cells with phorbol esters strongly induced the expression of IL-2R alpha and the activation of NF.kappa B.
('IL-2', 'Negative_regulation', 'IL-2R alpha')

This activation was due to the translocation of p65 and c-Rel NF.kappa B proteins from cytoplasmic stores to the nucleus, where they bound the kappa B sequence of the IL-2R alpha promoter either as p50.p65 or as p50.c-Rel heterodimers.
('IL-2', 'Negative_regulation', 'IL-2R alpha')

Furthermore, cyclosporin A, which blocked TNF alpha production induced by PKC, strongly inhibited IL-2R alpha and NF.kappa B activation.
('TNF alpha', 'Negative_regulation', 'IL-2R alpha'),('IL-2', 'Negative_regulation', 'IL-2R alpha')

The addition of either TNF alpha or IL-2 partially recovered cyclosporin A-induced IL-2R alpha inhibition, but only TNF alpha completely recovered NF.kappa B activation.
('TNF alpha', 'Negative_regulation', 'IL-2R alpha'),('IL-2', 'Negative_regulation', 'IL-2R alpha')

Those results indicate that, in resting T cells, PKC activation has only a triggering role, whereas the endogenously secreted TNF alpha plays an essential role in the quantitative control of the expression of IL-2R alpha chain or NF.kappa B activation.

Transcription factors RUNX1 and RUNX3 in the induction and suppressive function of Foxp3+inducible regulatory T cells
('RUNX3', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3')

In this study, we show that the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) induces the expression of the Runt-related transcription factors RUNX1 and RUNX3 in CD4+ T cells.
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'RUNX3'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'RUNX1')

Inactivation of the gene encoding RUNX cofactor core-binding factor-beta (CBFbeta) in mice and small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated suppression of RUNX1 and RUNX3 in human T cells resulted in reduced expression of Foxp3.
('core-binding factor-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3'),('RUNX3', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3')

Circulating human CD4+ CD25high CD127- T reg cells significantly expressed higher levels of RUNX3, FOXP3, and TGF-beta mRNA compared with CD4+CD25- cells.
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'RUNX3')

These data demonstrate Runx transcription factors as a molecular link in TGF-beta-induced Foxp3 expression in iT reg cell differentiation and function.

Tpl-2 induces IL-2 expression in T-cell lines by triggering multiple signaling pathways that activate NFAT and NF-kappaB.
('Tpl-2', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2')

The Tpl-2 kinase activates the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) and induces IL-2 expression in T-cell lines.
('Tpl-2', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2')

Here we show that the activation of the IL-2 promoter by Tpl-2 is inhibited by mutant signaling molecules that inhibit the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) or the calcineurin/NFAT pathways and is promoted by combinations of signaling molecules that activate these pathways.
('Tpl-2', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2')

We, therefore, conclude that signals generated by the convergence of the MAPK and the calcineurin/NFAT pathway are necessary and sufficient for the activation of the IL-2 promoter by Tpl-2.
('Tpl-2', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2')

However, it was only the IL-2 promoter whose activation by Tpl-2 was fully blocked by the dominant negative mutant MEK1S218/222A and the MEK1/MEK2 inhibitor PD098059.
('Tpl-2', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2')

While the activation of the IL-2 promoter and an NFAT-driven minimal promoter by Tpl-2 was fully blocked by the dominant negative mutant NFAT delta418, it was only partially blocked by the calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporin A suggesting that the Tpl-2-mediated NFAT activation is under the control of a combination of calcineurin-dependent and independent pathways.
('Tpl-2', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2')

In HIV-1-infected monocytes Tat sustains the NF-kappaB activity and promotes the transcriptional activation of MIP-1alpha by interacting with IkappaB-alpha and p65
('p65', 'Gene_expression', 'MIP-1alpha'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65'),('Tat', 'Gene_expression', 'IkappaB-alpha'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'MIP-1alpha'),('Tat', 'Gene_expression', 'MIP-1alpha')

We next analysed whether Tat affected the NF-kappaB activity and the expression of MIP-1alpha in the course of HIV-1 infection.
('Tat', 'Binding', 'MIP-1alpha'),('Tat', 'Gene_expression', 'MIP-1alpha')

Cells were transfected with siRNA Tat, siRNA control or left untransfected to modulate the Tat expression, and then analysed for the kinetic of NF-kappaB activation following viral infection.
('siRNA Tat', 'Gene_expression', 'Tat')

The expression of Tat and p24 was detected at 3- to 12-h post-infection, while it was barely detected in siRNA Tat-transfected cells (Figure 6A).
('siRNA Tat', 'Gene_expression', 'Tat'),('siRNA Tat', 'Gene_expression', 'p24')

The NF-kappaB activity, as measured by p65 DNA binding, was induced at 3-h post-infection in both Tat-positive (no siRNA and siRNA control) and Tat-negative cells (siRNA Tat), and increased at 12 h only in Tat-positive cells (Figure 6B).
('siRNA Tat', 'Gene_expression', 'Tat'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65')

Degradation of IkappaB-alpha was observed at 3-h post-infection, and was followed by de novo synthesis of IkappaB-alpha at 12 h independently of the Tat presence (Figure 6C).
('IkappaB-alpha', 'Gene_expression', 'IkappaB-alpha'),('Tat', 'Gene_expression', 'IkappaB-alpha')

In HIV-1-infected U937 cells, the endogenous Tat was coimmunoprecipitated with IkappaB-alpha and p65 (Figure 6E), and activated the MIP-1alpha expression in a p65-dependent manner, as shown by the lack of effect following RNA interference of Tat or p65 (Figure 6F).
('p65', 'Gene_expression', 'MIP-1alpha'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65'),('Tat', 'Gene_expression', 'IkappaB-alpha'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'MIP-1alpha'),('Tat', 'Gene_expression', 'MIP-1alpha')

Moreover, Tat and p65 were both recruited to the NF-kappaB enhancer of MIP-1alpha, while the p65 occupancy was abolished by siRNA Tat (Figure 6G and H).

Altogether these results indicated that in single round HIV-1 infection Tat associated with IkappaB-alpha and p65, and induced the p65-dependent activation of MIP-1alpha expression through occupancy of the MIP-1alpha promoter and increased recruitment of p65.

Interferon regulatory factor 2 (IRF-2) is a transcriptional regulatory protein that terminates interferon beta expression initiated by interferon regulatory factor 1.
('IRF-2', 'Gene_expression', 'interferon beta'),('interferon regulatory factor 1', 'Gene_expression', 'interferon beta'),('interferon regulatory factor 1', 'Transcription', 'IRF-2')

This region contains elements which are shared with the transcriptional enhancers of other genes including interferon regulatory factor 1, interferon beta, and interferon-inducible genes.
('interferon regulatory factor 1', 'Gene_expression', 'interferon beta')

These data suggest that interferon regulatory factor 1 not only triggers the activation of the interferon signal transduction pathway, but also may play a role in limiting the duration of this response by activating the transcription of IRF-2.
('interferon regulatory factor 1', 'Transcription', 'IRF-2')

Targeted degradation of c-Fos, but not v-Fos, by a phosphorylation-dependent signal on c-Jun.
('c-Jun', 'Protein_catabolism', 'c-Fos')

The proto-oncogene products c-Fos and c-Jun heterodimerize through their leucine zippers to form the AP-1 transcription factor.
('c-Jun', 'Protein_catabolism', 'c-Fos')

In transient expression and in vitro degradation experiments, the stability of c-Fos was decreased when the protein was dimerized with phosphorylated c-Jun.
('c-Jun', 'Protein_catabolism', 'c-Fos')

c-Jun protein isolated from phorbol ester-induced cells did not target c-Fos for degradation, which suggests that c-Fos is transiently stabilized after stimulation of cell growth.
('c-Fos', 'Negative_regulation', 'c-Fos'),('c-Jun', 'Protein_catabolism', 'c-Fos')

v-Fos protein, the retroviral counterpart of c-Fos, was not susceptible to degradation targeted by c-Jun.

In HIV-1 infection Tat sustains the NF-kappaB activity and enhances the MIP-1alpha expression via interaction with IkappaB-alpha and p65.

Even though Cbfb-deficient CD4+ T cells had impaired induction of Foxp3 after stimulation with anti-CD3/28 mAbs and TGF-beta, sufficient numbers of Foxp3+ cells could be generated to permit analysis of their suppressive activity.
('Cbfb', 'Positive_regulation', 'Foxp3')

Purified naive CD4+ T cells from CbfbF/F CD4-cre and control CbfbF/+ CD4-cre mice (Cd45.2) harboring a Foxp3-ires-GFP allele (Bettelli et al., 2006) were stimulated in vitro with anti-CD3/28 mAbs, IL-2, and TGF-beta.
('Cbfb', 'Positive_regulation', 'Foxp3')

The suppression was significantly reduced when cells from CbfbF/F CD4-cre mice were used, demonstrating that TGF-beta-induced Runx complexes are important for the suppressive activity of Foxp3+ T reg cells (Fig.
('Cbfb', 'Positive_regulation', 'Foxp3')

Foxp3+ and Foxp3- cells generated from both CbfbF/F CD4-cre and control cells all displayed similar proliferation rates and cell death as measured by CFSE dilution and annexin V staining, respectively (Fig.
('Cbfb', 'Positive_regulation', 'Foxp3')

These results demonstrate the important role of RUNX1 and RUNX3 not only for the induction of FOXP3, but also for the suppressive capacity of iT reg cells both in humans and in mice.
('RUNX1', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

In the suppression experiment with human cells, reduced suppressive activity was caused by reduced FOXP3 expression in T cells by siRNA inhibition of RUNX1 and RUNX3.

Recombinant NFAT1 can mediate transcription of the interleukin-2, interleukin-4, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor promoters in T cells, suggesting that NFAT1 contributes to the CsA-sensitive transcription of these genes during the immune response.
('NFAT1', 'Transcription', 'interleukin-4'),('NFAT1', 'Transcription', 'interleukin-2'),('NFAT1', 'Transcription', 'granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor'),('NFAT1', 'Transcription', 'tumor necrosis factor alpha')

Both c-Rel and RelA induced jagged1 gene expression, whereas a mutant defective for transactivation did not.
('c-Rel', 'Gene_expression', 'jagged1'),('RelA', 'Gene_expression', 'jagged1')

Importantly, jagged1 transcripts were also upregulated by endogenous NF-kappaB activation and this effect was inhibited by a dominant mutant of IkappaBalpha, a physiological inhibitor of NF-kappaB.
('IkappaBalpha', 'Positive_regulation', 'jagged1')

These results demonstrate that c-Rel can trigger the Notch signaling pathway in neighboring cells by inducing jagged1 gene expression, and suggest a role for Jagged1 in B-cell activation, differentiation or function.
('c-Rel', 'Gene_expression', 'jagged1')

GATA-3 determines Th2 cell differentiation and selectively activates the promoters of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 through chromatin remodelling [4]-[7].
('GATA-3', 'Gene_expression', '-13'),('GATA-3', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-5')

The key role of GATA-3 in allergic airway inflammation has been demonstrated in mice by the reduced release of Th2 cytokines in animals treated with dominant-negative mutants of GATA-3 and by local application of antisense oligonucleotides to GATA-3 [8],[9].
('GATA-3', 'Binding', 'GATA-3')

Corticosteroids mediate their anti-inflammatory effects through binding to glucocorticoid receptors (GRs), which then translocate to the nucleus where they interact with glucocorticoid response elements (GREs) in the promoter regions of steroid-sensitive genes.
('GR', 'Localization', 'GR')

Using overexpression and CAT-reporter genes, Lavender and colleagues [33] have shown that GR reduced GATA-3-mediated IL-5 and -13 promoter activity in human CD4+ T cells.
('GATA-3', 'Gene_expression', '-13'),('GR', 'Binding', 'GATA-3'),('GATA-3', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-5')

The authors postulated that local recruitment of GR may alter the ability of GATA-3 either to bind to its target site, to cause transcriptional up-regulation, or to maintain an environment that is permissive for transcription.
('GR', 'Binding', 'GATA-3')

However, although Wnt signals are known to inhibit the activity of the negative regulatory protein kinase glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta), resulting in increased levels of beta-catenin, we find no evidence for involvement of GSK-3beta in Tcf-mediated transcription in T cells.
('GSK-3beta', 'Positive_regulation', 'beta-catenin')

IL-10 Production by Th2 and Th17 Cells Also Requires ERK1 and ERK2 Activation
('ERK2', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('ERK1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

To address whether IL-10 production by Th2 and Th17 cells was also dependent on ERK1 and ERK2 activation, we differentiated these cells with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 in the absence of APCs (Shoemaker et al., 2006; Veldhoen et al., 2009; Veldhoen et al., 2006), in the presence or absence of the MEK inhibitor (PD184352).
('ERK2', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('ERK1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('MEK', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

We showed that ERK1 and ERK2 activation is a common pathway required for induction of IL-10 in different Th cell subsets because IL-10 production by both Th2 and Th17 cells was markedly inhibited in the presence of the MEK inhibitor (PD184352) (Figure 5D and Figure S5B).
('ERK2', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('ERK1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('MEK', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Activation of the ERK1 and ERK2 signaling pathway is therefore a common requirement for the induction of IL-10 production by Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells.
('ERK2', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('ERK1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Although TGF-beta-reduced CD25, IL-4 expression, and CD25 expression (Figure 6B), IL-4 significantly inhibited TGF-beta-mediated induction of FOXP3 in naive T cells driven toward FOXP3+ T cells, as shown by FACS analysis (Figure 6A).
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-4'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'CD25'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Negative_regulation', 'CD25')

It is known that IL-4 is a potent growth factor and may therefore favor the proliferation of FOXP3- cells and thus decrease the relative percentage of FOXP3+ cells.
('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

However, analysis of cell division kinetics by CFSE-labeling demonstrated that IL-4 did not differentially promote cell growth of FOXP3+ over that of FOXP3-.
('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

Furthermore the TGF-beta-mediated induction of FOXP3 expression was not caused by overgrowth of a CD25-FOXP3+ minority, since the number of FOXP3+ cells was low/absent in the purified CD4+CD45RA+ T cells (between 0% and 1%), and the FOXP3+ cells were not confined to the highly divided cells.
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'CD25')

CD25 was down-regulated in TGF-beta-treated cells compare to activated T cells, which was even more pronounced in cells cultured with TGF-beta and IL-4.
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-4'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'CD25'),('IL-4', 'Negative_regulation', 'CD25')

The addition of IL-4 to iTreg-driving conditions decreased the number of FOXP3+ cells (Figure 6B).
('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

In line with the previous findings, the IL-4-producing cells and the FOXP3 expressing cells are nonoverlapping populations.
('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

The expression kinetic of naive T cells exposed to IL-4 and TGF-beta demonstrated that GATA3 and FOXP3 are initially found in separate populations (day 2), but transiently co-express both factors (days 4-8), before establishing separate populations at the end of the differentiation process (day 10; Figure 6C), suggesting that GATA3 inhibits the development of iTreg cells by repressing FOXP3.
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-4'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'GATA3'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'GATA3'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

These results showed that IL-4 acts in vitro as an inhibitor of FOXP3 expression, without interfering with TGF-beta signaling, probably acting at the level of transcription factors, and possibly by a GATA3-dependent mechanism.

('hGATA-3', 'Transcription', 'TcR delta'),('hGATA-3', 'Gene_expression', 'TcR delta')

All NK clones and cell lines studied were found to express hGATA-3-specific mRNA, suggesting that hGATA-3 may be involved in the regulation of the unrearranged TcR delta gene expression in NK cells.

LMP1 Upregulates IL10 and Constitutively Activates Stat3
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL10'),('IL10', 'Positive_regulation', 'Stat3')

Transcription of IL10, IL15, and IFNgamma were reproducibly detected in LMP1 transgenic lymphocytes and lymphoma cells and was higher than in the B cell lymphoma cell lines 967 and K46mu (Figure 5A).
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL10'),('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'IFNgamma'),('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL15')

There was no significant difference in the expression of IL15 and IFNgamma between LMP1 transgenic lymphocytes and lymphoma cells, suggesting that upregulation of IL15 and IFNgamma is induced by LMP1 expression in healthy lymphocytes but is not a unique property of malignant lymphocytes.
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'IFNgamma'),('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL15')

Strikingly, IL10, a B lymphocyte stimulatory cytokine, was increased 1.5- to 5-fold in the wild-type and LMP1 transgenic lymphoma cells compared to LMP1 transgenic lymphocytes (Figure 5A).
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL10')

Immunoblot analysis indicated that LMP1 transgenic lymphocytes and wild-type and LMP1 transgenic lymphoma cells had corresponding increased levels of phosphorylated alpha and beta isoforms of activated Stat3, a target of the IL10 receptor (Figure 5B).
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL10'),('IL10', 'Positive_regulation', 'Stat3')

However, when comparing the same lymphomas, there was no correlation between the levels of IL10 induction and the levels of Stat3 activation.
('IL10', 'Positive_regulation', 'Stat3')

This suggests that the activation of Stat3 is not solely induced by IL10 or that Stat3 activation may be constitutive.
('IL10', 'Positive_regulation', 'Stat3')

Additionally, there was no correlation between the levels of LMP1 expression and the levels of IL10 induction (Figures 1A and 5A).
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL10')

This indicates that the induction of IL10 is a general property associated with enhanced survival and may only be indirectly affected by LMP1.
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL10')

Neutralizing antibodies to IL10 did not affect the survival of lymphoma cells as determined by the MTS assay (unpublished data), suggesting constitutive activation of Stat3.
('IL10', 'Positive_regulation', 'Stat3')

This was confirmed by immunoblot analysis such that in the presence of anti-IL10 neutralizing antibodies, pStat3 levels remained activated in lymphoma cells isolated from wild-type and LMP1 transgenic lymphomas (Figure 5C).
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL10'),('IL10', 'Positive_regulation', 'pStat3'),('IL10', 'Positive_regulation', 'Stat3')

Exogenous addition of IL10 enhanced pStat3 activation above constitutive levels, indicating that lymphoma cells are responsive to IL10 treatment (Figure 5C).
('IL10', 'Positive_regulation', 'pStat3'),('IL10', 'Positive_regulation', 'Stat3')

This means that although the lymphoma cells have constitutive Stat3 activation, it may be further enhanced by IL10 induction.
('IL10', 'Positive_regulation', 'Stat3')

Nuclear translocation of pStat3 is a consequence of activation, and nuclear pStat3 was not detected by immunohistochemistry staining of spleen sections from control mice.

Role of CBFbeta in the induction of Foxp3
('CBFbeta', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3')

To target all Runx proteins that might be involved in the induction of Foxp3, we used mice in which loxP-flanked Cbfb alleles were inactivated in T cells through expression of a CD4-cre transgene.
('Runx', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3'),('Runx', 'Positive_regulation', 'Foxp3')

Retinoic acid and TGF-beta synergize in the induction of Foxp3 in naive T cells (Kang et al., 2007).
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3')

To investigate whether Runx-mediated induction of Foxp3 is dependent on the expression of CBFbeta, naive CD4+ CD8- T cells from CbfbF/F CD4-cre and control CbfbF/+ CD4-cre mice were stimulated with anti-CD3/28 mAbs, retinoic acid, and increasing concentrations of TGF-beta.
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3'),('Runx', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3'),('CBFbeta', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3'),('Runx', 'Positive_regulation', 'Foxp3')

After 3 d in culture, the cells were restimulated with PMA and ionomycin and analyzed for intracellular Foxp3 and IFN-gamma expression.
('IFN-gamma', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3')

TGF-beta induced Foxp3 in CbfbF/+ CD4-cre cells in a dose dependent manner, and this was significantly reduced in CbfbF/F CD4-cre cells.
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3')

Retinoic acid enhanced Foxp3 expression even in 20 pg/ml of TGF-beta and more than 95% of the CD4+ T cells from CbfbF/+ CD4-cre mice became Foxp3+ in 100 and 500 pg/ml TGF-beta doses.
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3')

The induction of Foxp3 was again significantly lower in CbfbF/F CD4-cre CD4+ T cells even in the presence of retinoic acid, demonstrating that deficiency in Runx binding to DNA affects the TGF-beta induction of Foxp3 in T reg cells (Fig.
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3'),('Runx', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3'),('Runx', 'Positive_regulation', 'Foxp3')

There was no difference in the induction of Foxp3 when endogenous IL-4 and IFN-gamma were neutralized (Fig.

The importance of RUNX transcription factors for the in vivo conversion of naive CD4+ T cells into iT reg cells was examined.

To investigate the effect of RUNX1 and RUNX3 binding to the RUNX binding sites in the FOXP3 promoter, we transfected human peripheral blood CD4+ T cells with a FOXP3 promoter luciferase reporter vector and RUNX1 or RUNX3 expression vectors.
('RUNX3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

An increase in luciferase activity was observed only when the FOXP3 promoter (-511 to +176) luciferase construct was cotransfected with RUNX1 or RUNX3 expression vectors (Fig.
('RUNX3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

In these experiments, the overexpression of RUNX1 and RUNX3 eliminated the need of TGF-beta for FOXP3 promoter activation and PMA/ionomycin stimulation was sufficient.

To examine the role of each of the three RUNX binding sites for the FOXP3 promoter activity, we mutated each individually or in combination.

4 B), suggesting that the identified binding sites have redundant functions and RUNX binding to more than one site is necessary for the full activation of the FOXP3 promoter.
('RUNX', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

Supporting these findings, the overexpression of RUNX1 in human primary CD4+ T cells resulted in significantly elevated levels of FOXP3 protein measured by flow cytometry after 48 h. This was achieved without any requirement for anti-CD3, anti-CD28 stimulation, or the presence of TGF-beta.

Regulation of M-CSF expression by M-CSF: role of protein kinase C and transcription factor NF kappa B.
('M-CSF', 'Gene_expression', 'M-CSF')

The detection of both M-CSF and c-fms expression by cells of the monocyte lineage has suggested that M-CSF may act by an autocrine mechanism.
('M-CSF', 'Gene_expression', 'M-CSF')

Although sensitivity to M-CSF can be modulated by regulation of receptor expression and function, M-CSF responsiveness is largely determined at a postreceptor level.
('M-CSF', 'Gene_expression', 'M-CSF')

Inhibition of PKC by the isoquinoline derivative H7 abolishes induction of M-CSF by M-CSF.

('M-CSF', 'Gene_expression', 'M-CSF')

BACKGROUND: The induction of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and E-selectin by tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) is mediated by mobilization of the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B).
('TNF', 'Localization', 'VCAM-1'),('TNF', 'Localization', 'E-selectin')

Induction of VCAM-1 and E-selectin surface expression by TNF was dose-dependently reduced by aspirin over the same range, while induction of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) was hardly affected.
('TNF', 'Localization', 'VCAM-1'),('TNF', 'Localization', 'E-selectin')

Aspirin appeared to prevent VCAM-1 transcription, since it dose-dependently inhibited induction of VCAM-1 mRNA by TNF.
('TNF', 'Localization', 'VCAM-1')

As a functional consequence, adhesion of U937 monocytes to TNF-stimulated HUVECs was markedly reduced by aspirin due to suppression of VCAM-1 and E-selectin upregulation.
('TNF', 'Localization', 'VCAM-1'),('TNF', 'Localization', 'E-selectin')

CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that aspirin inhibits NF-kappa B mobilization, induction of VCAM-1 and E-selectin, and subsequent monocyte adhesion in endothelial cells stimulated by TNF, thereby providing an additional mechanism for therapeutic effects of aspirin.

Recent studies indicate that HTLV-1 Tax targets IkappaBalpha to the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.
('Tax', 'Protein_catabolism', 'IkappaBalpha')

In this report, we provide evidence that in addition to acting on IkappaBalpha, Tax stimulates the turnover Of IkappaBbeta via a related targeting mechanism.
('Tax', 'Protein_catabolism', 'IkappaBalpha'),('Tax', 'Protein_catabolism', 'IkappaBbeta')

Like IkappaBalpha, Tax-mediated breakdown of IkappaBbeta in transfected T lymphocytes is blocked either by cell-permeable proteasome inhibitors or by mutation Of IkappaBbeta at two serine residues present within its N-terminal region.
('Tax', 'Protein_catabolism', 'IkappaBalpha'),('Tax', 'Protein_catabolism', 'IkappaBbeta')

Despite the dual specificity of HTLV-1 Tax for IkappaBalpha and IkappaBbeta at the protein level, Tax selectively stimulates NF-kappaB-directed transcription of the IkappaBalpha gene.
('Tax', 'Protein_catabolism', 'IkappaBalpha'),('Tax', 'Protein_catabolism', 'IkappaBbeta')

These findings with IkappaBbeta provide a potential mechanism for the constitutive activation of NF-kappaB in Tax-expressing cells.

Histamine transiently increased cAMP and c-fos expression through H2 receptors.
('H2 receptors', 'Gene_expression', 'c-fos')

Dose-dependence studies using histamine and dimaprit showed that the EC50 values for cAMP production and c-fos increase were similar, suggesting that cAMP might be involved in c-fos induction via H2 receptors.
('H2 receptors', 'Gene_expression', 'c-fos')

These results indicate that histamine activates several mechanisms involved in the induction of differentiation, such as cAMP and c-fos production, but fails to promote differentiation of U937 cells, apparently due to the rapid desensitization of H2 receptors.

Role of EGR1 in regulation of stimulus-dependent CD44 transcription in B lymphocytes.
('EGR1', 'Positive_regulation', 'CD44')

Here we identify the gene encoding the lymphocyte homing and migration protein CD44 as a target of EGR1 regulation in B cells.
('EGR1', 'Positive_regulation', 'CD44')

BCR-induced increases in CD44 mRNA expression and transcription levels are shown to occur in EGR1-expressing but not in nonexpressing subclones of the B-cell line WEHI-231.
('EGR1', 'Positive_regulation', 'CD44')

Kinetics of egr-1 transcription and the appearance of nuclear EGR1 protein precede CD44 induction and occur within 30 min after stimulation in the EGR1-expressing subclone.
('EGR1', 'Positive_regulation', 'CD44')

A single EGR1 binding motif is demonstrated at bp -301 of the human CD44 promoter.
('EGR1', 'Positive_regulation', 'CD44')

The EGR1 binding motif was shown to be necessary for stimulus-induced expression of a CD44 promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter construct in nontransformed B lymphocytes and was required for transactivation by an EGR1 expression vector in a B-cell line.
('EGR1', 'Positive_regulation', 'CD44')

These studies identify EGR1 as an intermediary linking BCR-derived signals to the induction of CD44.

v-erbA overexpression is required to extinguish c-erbA function in erythroid cell differentiation and regulation of the erbA target gene CAII.
('v-erbA', 'Transcription', 'CAII'),('v-erbA', 'Regulation', 'CAII')

Here, we show that v-erbA and c-erbA bind directly to sequences within the promoter of the erythrocyte-specific carbonic anhydrase II (CAII), a gene whose transcription is efficiently suppressed by v-erbA.
('v-erbA', 'Transcription', 'CAII'),('v-erbA', 'Regulation', 'CAII')

In the present report, we studied the role of the stromal-derived cytokine interleukin-7 (IL-7) in the IL-2-gene regulation in activated T lymphocytes.
('IL-7', 'Transcription', 'IL-2'),('IL-7', 'Regulation', 'IL-2')

Costimulation of phytohemagglutinin/anti-CD28 activated T lymphocytes with IL-7 induces a fivefold enhanced IL-2-mRNA accumulation and a 2.5-fold enhanced protein secretion.
('IL-7', 'Transcription', 'IL-2'),('IL-7', 'Regulation', 'IL-2')

The IL-2-gene transcription rate is increased 3.4-fold, indicating that the effect of IL-7 is in part mediated at the transcriptional level.

Activation of the interleukin 6 gene by Mycobacterium tuberculosis or lipopolysaccharide is mediated by nuclear factors NF-IL6 and NF-kappa B [published erratum appears in Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 1995 Apr 11;92(8):3632]

The role of the viral trans-activator Tax protein in the induction of VCAM-1 was first indicated by the detection of this adhesion molecule on Jurkat T-cell clones stably expressing the tax gene.
('Tax', 'Positive_regulation', 'VCAM-1'),('Tax', 'Transcription', 'VCAM-1'),('Tax', 'Gene_expression', 'VCAM-1')

The effect of Tax on VCAM-1 gene transcription was next confirmed in JPX-9 cells, a subclone of Jurkat cells, carrying the tax sequences under the control of an inducible promoter.
('Tax', 'Positive_regulation', 'VCAM-1'),('Tax', 'Transcription', 'VCAM-1'),('Tax', 'Gene_expression', 'VCAM-1')

Furthermore, deletion and mutation analyses of the VCAM-1 promoter performed with chloramphenicol acetyltransferase constructs revealed that Tax was trans activating the VCAM-1 promoter via two NF-kappaB sites present at bp -72 and -57 in the VCAM-1 gene promoter, with both of them being required for the Tax-induced expression of this adhesion molecule.
('Tax', 'Positive_regulation', 'VCAM-1'),('Tax', 'Transcription', 'VCAM-1'),('Tax', 'Gene_expression', 'VCAM-1')

Finally, gel mobility shift assays demonstrated the nuclear translocation of proteins specifically bound to these two NF-kappaB motifs, confirming that VCAM-1 was induced on Tax-expressing cells in a kappaB-dependent manner.
('Tax', 'Positive_regulation', 'VCAM-1'),('Tax', 'Transcription', 'VCAM-1'),('Tax', 'Gene_expression', 'VCAM-1')

Collectively, these results therefore suggest that the exclusive Tax-induced expression of VCAM-1 on T cells may represent a pivotal event in the progression of HTLV-1-associated diseases.

Runx3 controls Eomes, perforin, granzyme B, and IFN-gamma expression in effector CTLs.

Runx3+/+ or Runx3-/- CD8+ T cells were activated and transduced with retroviruses bearing an empty IRES-GFP cassette (GFP) or also encoding Eomes-VP16 (Eo-VP16) or Myc-Runx3 (Runx3).
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'Eomes')

T-bet is induced by TCR signals and is essential for early IFN-gamma expression.
('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma')

Runx3 is present in naive CD8+ T cells and represses Runx1 and induces Eomes, perforin, granzyme B, and IFN-gamma expression.

Eomes may participate in sustaining late IFN-gamma expression, whereas Runx3 and Eomes (but not T-bet) may cooperate to activate perforin expression.

A region that may also be important with respect to Foxp3 function is the leucine zipper domain, as demonstrated by the number of mutations associated with IPEX that have been mapped in this region of Foxp3.
('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'Foxp3')

Because the pathogenesis of a number of retroviral-induced immunologic disorders such as HIV-1/AIDS and HTLV-I/HAM/TSP have been associated with dysregulation of Foxp3 expression [8,45], we also examined the role of Foxp3 in retroviral gene expression.
('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'Foxp3')

In addition, the FKH domain of Foxp3 was required for this inhibitory effect in HEK 293T cells, but not in Jurkat T cells, similar to Foxp3-mediated suppression of a synthetic NF-kappaB reporter.
('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'Foxp3')

Foxp3 also affected two well-known functions of HTLV-I Tax: transactivation of the NF-kappaB pathway and, most surprisingly, transactivation of the HTLV-I LTR.
('Tax', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3')

Transactivation of the HTLV-I LTR by Tax involves the interaction of ATF/CREB factors with Tax in the nucleus.
('Tax', 'Binding', 'Tax')

Binding of Tax enhances ATF/CREB dimerization and promotes assembly of Tax-ATF/CREB complexes onto specific sequences in the viral promoter known as Tax-responsive elements.
('Tax', 'Binding', 'Tax')

Transactivation of the NF-kappaB pathway by Tax was inhibited by overexpression of full-length Foxp3, but not DeltaFKH, as seen with basal activation of the HIV-1 LTR and a synthetic NF-kappaB reporter in HEK 293T cells.
('Tax', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3')

However, Tax-mediated transactivation of the HTLV-I LTR was inhibited by overexpression of both full-length Foxp3 as well as DeltaFKH in both HEK 293T cells and CD4+ T cells.
('Tax', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3')

We demonstrated that Foxp3 did not directly affect the functioning of Tax, but rather Foxp3 targeted the transcription factors required for Tax transactivation (i.e., NF-kappaB and a then-unknown cellular factor, which we identified in this study as CREB).
('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'Foxp3'),('Tax', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3'),('Tax', 'Binding', 'Tax')

Importantly, we demonstrated that HTLV-I-infected individuals with the highest levels of Foxp3 protein expression within the CD4+CD25+ T cells population exhibited lower proviral loads than did individuals with the lowest levels of Foxp3 protein expression.
('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'Foxp3')

Therefore, Foxp3 becomes an attractive target for the development of novel therapeutic applications directed at modulating the expression of this important regulatory protein, especially in light of recent observations that the expression of Foxp3 can also be down-regulated by HTLV-I Tax [8].
('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'Foxp3'),('Tax', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3')

As the activation of the HTLV-I LTR depends primarily on ATF/CREB proteins (whether in the presence or the absence of Tax), we investigated whether Foxp3 could interact with this additional cellular signaling pathway.
('Tax', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3')

Our data demonstrate that Foxp3 interferes with the latter of these two processes and that the recruitment of the coactivator protein p300, and resulting transcriptional activation are blocked by Foxp3.
('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'p300'),('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'Foxp3')

This may be the result of the physical interaction we detected between Foxp3 and p300.
('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'p300')

With respect to HTLV-I LTR activity, while full-length Foxp3 inhibited both basal and Tax-dependent transcription by ~50%, DeltaFKH appeared less effective in suppressing basal activation (~25% inhibition) compared to Tax-dependent activation (~50% inhibition).
('Tax', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3'),('Tax', 'Binding', 'Tax')

Future studies will be directed at identifying and characterizing cellular proteins that interact with Foxp3 both in the nucleus and cytoplasm, in order to better address how Foxp3 functions to guide the development and function of regulatory T cells in health and disease.

Fab fragment of anti-E. chaffeensis immunoglobulin G complexed with E. chaffeensis did not induce any of these three cytokines, indicating that ehrlichial binding is required for IL-1beta mRNA expression and that binding of the immune complex to the Fc gamma receptor is required for TNF-alpha and IL-6 mRNA expression and enhanced IL-1beta mRNA expression.

CD40-mediated phosphorylation and degradation of IkappaBalpha in HOIP-deficient cells was dramatically impaired relative to that observed in parental A20.2J cells (Fig.

Coupling of the upstream beta globin sequence from approximately -500 to -250 bp to the truncated delta promoter fragment led to complete extinction of transcription activity, consistent with a negative regulatory effect of the beta globin gene upstream element(s).

We demonstrate that a fusion protein composed of a C-terminal Hsp70 peptide and the p50 subunit of NF-kappaB was directed into the nucleus of cells, could bind DNA specifically, and activated Igkappa expression and TNFalpha production.

Moreover, the mechanism of action of BHRF1 resembled that of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL as it inhibited TNF- and anti-Fas-induced activation of two enzymes participating in the apoptosis pathway, cytosolic phospholipase A2 and caspase-3/CPP32, but did not interfere with the activation of NF-kappaB-like transcription factors.

IL-12 and High Doses of Antigen Induce the Development of Th1 Cells Producing IL-10
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Culture of naive CD4+ T cells in an APC-free system by stimulation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies in the presence of IL-12 resulted in IFN-gamma-producing Th1 cells, a proportion of which coproduced IL-10, as did Th2 cells resulting from culture in IL-4 (Figure S1B).
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma')

To investigate whether the lack of IL-10 produced by Th1 cells resulted from inhibition of IL-10 production by DCs and high antigen dose or alternatively required IL-12, we cultured naive CD4+ T cells with increasing doses of antigen presented by DC in the presence of IL-12.
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

At low doses of antigen, IL-12 abrogated the development of Th2 cells and induced IFN-gamma expression but only low levels of IL-10 expression, suggesting that IL-12 per se was not sufficient to induce significant IL-10 production in Th1 cells (Figure 1A).
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma')

Strikingly, as the antigen dose was increased, Th1 populations driven with IL-12 now contained higher numbers of IL-10-producing cells (Figure 1A) and produced more IL-10 protein upon restimulation (Figures 1A and 1B).
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Thus, the development of Th1 cells producing IL-10 required both IL-12 and high doses of antigen.
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Th1 cells differentiated to produce large amounts of IL-10 and IFN-gamma and lost their capacity to produce IL-2 (Figure 1B).
('IL-2', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Because the presence of IL-12 reduced the proliferation of CD4+ T cells at both high and low antigen doses (Table S1), and only the former showed IL-10 production, the development of high IL-10-producing cells is most likely not related to limited IL-2.
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-2', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Naive CD4+ T cells from DO11.10/recombination-activating gene 1 (Rag1)-deficient animals, cultured with high doses of antigen in the presence of IL-12, also resulted in IL-10 expression by Th1 cells, showing that this expression was not dependent on the presence of effector or memory T cells or Treg cells (Figure S2).
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Although it has been suggested that TGF-beta can induce IL-10 in CD4+ T cells (Kitani et al., 2003; Schiott et al., 2000), we found that in developing Th1 and Th2 cells this was not the case (data not shown).
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

In fact, neutralization of TGF-beta led to increased IL-10 production by both T cell subsets (Figure S3).
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Thus, the development of IL-10-producing Th1 cells only depended on the presence of IL-12 together with high antigen dose and not on other soluble factors such as IL-2 or TGF-beta or on the presence of other T cell types.

Infection of human peripheral blood lymphocytes with HIV-1 in vitro resulted in increased interleukin-2 (IL-2) secretion in response to T cell activation via the CD3 and CD28 receptors.
('CD28', 'Localization', 'IL-2')

Expression of the HIV-1 transactivator Tat recapitulated this phenotype and was associated with increased IL-2 secretion in response to costimulation with CD3 plus CD28.
('CD28', 'Localization', 'IL-2')

IL-2 superinduction by Tat occurred at the transcriptional level, was mediated by the CD28-responsive element in the IL-2 promoter, and was exclusively dependent on the 29 amino acids encoded by the second exon of Tat.
('CD28', 'Localization', 'IL-2')

We recently demonstrated that HOIL-1L interacting protein (HOIP), a ubiquitin ligase that can catalyze the assembly of linear polyubiquitin chains [5], is recruited to CD40 in a TRAF2-dependent manner following engagement of CD40 by agonistic antibody [6].
('TRAF2', 'Binding', 'HOIL-1L interacting protein')

We found that the CD40-induced upregulation of CD80 (a costimulatory molecule for T cells) was defective in HOIP-deficient cells.

Involvement of adenylate cyclase and p70(S6)-kinase activation in IL-10 up-regulation in human monocytes by gp41 envelope protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1.
('gp41', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('p70(S6)-kinase', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('gp41', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10')

Our previous results show that recombinant gp41 (aa565-647), the extracellular domain of HIV-1 transmembrane glycoprotein, stimulates interleukin-10 (IL-10) production in human monocytes.
('gp41', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('gp41', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10')

In this study, we examined whether gp41-induced IL-10 up-regulation is mediated by the previously described synergistic activation of cAMP and NF-kappaB pathways.
('gp41', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('gp41', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10')

gp41 induced cAMP accumulation in monocytes in a time- and concentration-dependent manner and the adenylate cyclase inhibitor SQ 22536 suppressed gp41-induced IL-10 production in monocytes.
('gp41', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('gp41', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10')

In contrast, gp41 failed to stimulate NF-kappaB binding activity in as much as no NF-kappaB bound to the main NF-kappaB-binding site 2 of the IL-10 promoter after addition of gp41.
('gp41', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('gp41', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10')

Specific inhibitors of p70(S6)-kinase (rapamycin), and Gi protein (pertussis toxin), prevented induction of IL-10 production by gp41 in monocytes, while inhibitors of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) (wortmannin) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway (PD 98059) did not.
('gp41', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('p70(S6)-kinase', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('gp41', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10')

Thus HIV-1 gp41-induced IL-10 up-regulation in monocytes may not involve NF-kappaB, MAPK, or PI 3-kinase activation, but rather may operate through activation of adenylate cyclase and pertussis-toxin-sensitive Gi/Go protein to effect p70(S6)-kinase activation.

LMP1 Activates Akt Signaling and Deregulates the Rb Cell Cycle Pathway
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'Akt')

LMP1 transformation of rodent fibroblasts requires activation of PI3K and Akt [5].
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'Akt')

To determine if Akt signaling is activated in LMP1 transgenic mice, pAkt and several of its targets were assessed by immunoblotting of splenic CD19+ MACS-purified B cells.
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'Akt')

LMP1 transgenic B cells had increased levels of pAkt compared to wild-type lymphocytes; however, progression to lymphoma in both LMP1-positive and -negative lymphoma cells did not further increase pAkt levels.
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'Akt')

This finding indicates that GSK3 is not a target of activated Akt in the LMP1 transgenic lymphocytes and lymphoma cells.
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'Akt')

Activated p-mTOR was not increased in LMP1 transgenic lymphocytes or lymphoma cells, indicating that this pathway is not affected by LMP1-induced Akt activation and does not contribute to lymphoma development (Figure 6B).
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'Akt')

Immunoblot analysis indicated that total FoxO1 levels were greatly decreased in wild-type and LMP1 transgenic lymphomas (Figure 6B), suggesting that inhibition of the Forkhead signaling pathway is an important target of Akt in lymphoma development.
('Akt', 'Negative_regulation', 'FoxO1'),('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'Akt')

However, considering that Akt activation did not induce FoxO1 degradation in LMP1 transgenic B cells, Akt may not be the sole regulator of FoxO1, and it may be that progression to lymphoma requires modulation of multiple pathways.
('Akt', 'Negative_regulation', 'FoxO1'),('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'Akt')

Even though Cbfb-deficient CD4+ T cells had impaired induction of Foxp3 after stimulation with anti-CD3/28 mAbs and TGF-beta, sufficient numbers of Foxp3+ cells could be generated to permit analysis of their suppressive activity.
('Cbfb', 'Positive_regulation', 'Foxp3')

Purified naive CD4+ T cells from CbfbF/F CD4-cre and control CbfbF/+ CD4-cre mice (Cd45.2) harboring a Foxp3-ires-GFP allele (Bettelli et al., 2006) were stimulated in vitro with anti-CD3/28 mAbs, IL-2, and TGF-beta.
('Cbfb', 'Positive_regulation', 'Foxp3')

The suppression was significantly reduced when cells from CbfbF/F CD4-cre mice were used, demonstrating that TGF-beta-induced Runx complexes are important for the suppressive activity of Foxp3+ T reg cells (Fig.
('Cbfb', 'Positive_regulation', 'Foxp3')

Foxp3+ and Foxp3- cells generated from both CbfbF/F CD4-cre and control cells all displayed similar proliferation rates and cell death as measured by CFSE dilution and annexin V staining, respectively (Fig.
('Cbfb', 'Positive_regulation', 'Foxp3')

These results demonstrate the important role of RUNX1 and RUNX3 not only for the induction of FOXP3, but also for the suppressive capacity of iT reg cells both in humans and in mice.
('RUNX1', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

In the suppression experiment with human cells, reduced suppressive activity was caused by reduced FOXP3 expression in T cells by siRNA inhibition of RUNX1 and RUNX3.

We have now examined expression of the mouse E2A gene at the protein level using polyclonal antisera directed against distinct portions of the E2A protein to probe blots of cellular extracts.
('E2A', 'Positive_regulation', 'E2A')

Our results are consistent with the view that the DNA-binding activity LEF1/BCF1 is a homodimer of E2A proteins; the selective appearance of this putative cell-specific transcription factor in B lymphoid cells seems to be attributable, at least in part, to the elevated E2A protein concentrations in these cells.
('E2A', 'Positive_regulation', 'E2A')

We demonstrate in this report that the 5' flanking DNA of the 15-lox gene contains sequences which down-regulate its activity in a variety of non-erythroid cell lines but not in two erythroid cell lines.

Based on the evidence that Tat enhanced the transcriptional activity of the p65 subunit of NF-kappaB (49,63,64), and physically interacted with the IkappaB-alpha repressor (50,51), we investigated the possibility that Tat could activate NF-kappaB via direct interaction with IkappaB-alpha and p65.
('p65', 'Binding', 'Tat'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'IkappaB-alpha'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'Tat'),('p65', 'Regulation', 'p65'),('Tat', 'Negative_regulation', 'p65')

Upon HIV-1 infection, the early NF-kappaB activation occurred concomitantly with IKK activation and IkappaB-alpha degradation in the absence of Tat.
('Tat', 'Binding', 'IkappaB-alpha')

Soon after the shut off of IKK activity and new synthesis of IkappaB-alpha, the NF-kappaB activity was kept elevated in the presence of Tat, while it was down regulated upon silencing of the Tat gene.
('Tat', 'Binding', 'IkappaB-alpha'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'Tat')

These findings indicate that in single round HIV-1 infection, Tat enhanced the NF-kappaB activity without affecting the IKK activity and the half-life of IkappaB-alpha.
('Tat', 'Binding', 'IkappaB-alpha')

Similar kinetic of NF-kappaB activation occurred upon short-pulse of PMA in Tat-transfected HeLa cells, where Tat inhibited the post-activation turn off of NF-kappaB in presence of newly synthesized IkappaB-alpha.
('Tat', 'Binding', 'IkappaB-alpha'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'Tat')

The Tat-dependent activation of NF-kappaB correlated with the association of the viral protein with IkappaB-alpha, which interfered with the generation of the IkappaB-alpha/p65 complex.
('p65', 'Binding', 'Tat'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'IkappaB-alpha'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65'),('Tat', 'Negative_regulation', 'p65')

This evidence demonstrated that Tat competed for the binding of IkappaB-alpha to p65 and prevented the IkappaB-alpha repression of p65.
('p65', 'Binding', 'Tat'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'IkappaB-alpha'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65'),('p65', 'Regulation', 'p65'),('Tat', 'Negative_regulation', 'p65')

As additional mechanism of NF-kappaB activation, Tat associated with p65 and increased the p65 binding affinity to the NF-kappaB enhancer; this evidence was obtained with recombinant proteins indicating that the stronger binding of p65 to DNA was a consequence of direct association with Tat, which likely caused a conformational change of p65.
('p65', 'Binding', 'Tat'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'Tat'),('p65', 'Regulation', 'p65'),('Tat', 'Negative_regulation', 'p65')

We also demonstrated that the Tat cysteine-rich sequence (C22,25,27) was involved in the binding to the RHD of p65 and NF-kappaB activation.
('p65', 'Binding', 'Tat'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65'),('Tat', 'Negative_regulation', 'p65')

Differently, the Tat arginine-rich sequence (R49,52,53,55,56,57) was required for the binding to the sixth ankyrin of IkappaB-alpha (50,51), and for releasing p65 from the IkappaB-alpha inhibition.
('p65', 'Binding', 'Tat'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'IkappaB-alpha'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65'),('Tat', 'Negative_regulation', 'p65')

Altogether these results demonstrated that Tat abolished the negative feedback regulation of NF-kappaB by hijacking the IkappaB-alpha repressor, shielding p65 from the IkappaB-alpha embrace, and enforcing the p65 binding to DNA.
('p65', 'Binding', 'Tat'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'IkappaB-alpha'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65'),('p65', 'Regulation', 'p65'),('Tat', 'Negative_regulation', 'p65')

Further evidence of Tat activation of NF-kappaB showed that wild-type Tat, and not the Tat mutants lacking the arginine- or cysteine-rich domains, up-regulated in vivo the expression of a number of NF-kappaB-responsive genes, including MIP-1alpha, CSF3, LTA, NFKBIA and TLR2.
('Tat', 'Binding', 'Tat')

By ChIP analysis, we observed that Tat increased the recruitment of p65 to the NF-kappaB enhancers of the activated genes, and was recovered at the same sites.
('p65', 'Binding', 'Tat'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65'),('Tat', 'Negative_regulation', 'p65')

RNA interference of p65 abolished the Tat occupancy of the NF-kappaB enhancers indicating that the Tat binding to the NF-kappaB sites was mediated by p65.
('p65', 'Binding', 'Tat'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'Tat'),('p65', 'Regulation', 'p65'),('Tat', 'Negative_regulation', 'p65')

These results were consistent with the evidence that Tat displaced p65 from the binding to IkappaB-alpha (Figures 2D and 3C), and increased the p65 DNA binding affinity through association (Figure 4E and F).
('p65', 'Binding', 'Tat'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'IkappaB-alpha'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65'),('p65', 'Regulation', 'p65'),('Tat', 'Negative_regulation', 'p65')

Thus, Tat likely increased the recruitment of p65 to the NF-kappaB-dependent promoters by associating with p65 and by interfering with the assembly of p65 with the repressor IkappaB-alpha.
('p65', 'Binding', 'Tat'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'IkappaB-alpha'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65'),('p65', 'Regulation', 'p65'),('Tat', 'Negative_regulation', 'p65')

Of interest, IkappaB-alpha was found associated to the NF-kappaB enhancers in absence of Tat, where it was displaced in presence of Tat.
('Tat', 'Binding', 'IkappaB-alpha'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'Tat')

Indeed, IkappaB-alpha was found associated with hystone deacetylases at the hes1 promoter, from where it was removed following TNF-alpha stimulation causing histone acetylation and hes1 transcriptional activation (65).

A similar mechanism of gene regulation could apply to the NF-kappaB-dependent genes analysed in this study, where Tat could activate the gene expression by removing IkappaB-alpha and promoting the p65 loading (Figure 7).
('p65', 'Binding', 'Tat'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'IkappaB-alpha'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65'),('Tat', 'Negative_regulation', 'p65')

The physiological relevance of Tat cross talk with NF-kappaB was demonstrated in the HIV-1 infection of human monocytes, where HIV-1-encoded Tat protein counteracted post-activation turn off of NF-kappaB, as shown by: (i) sustained NF-kappaB activity by Tat in presence of newly synthesized IkappaB-alpha; (ii) coimmunoprecipitation of Tat with IkappaB-alpha and p65; (iii) induction of MIP-1alpha expression dependent on Tat and p65; (iv) Tat occupancy of the MIP-1alpha NF-kappaB enhancer associated with increased recruitment of p65.

This study supports the pro-inflammatory action of Tat through physical interaction with p65 and IkappaB-alpha.
('p65', 'Binding', 'Tat'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'IkappaB-alpha'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65'),('Tat', 'Negative_regulation', 'p65')

In the case of TNF-alpha and IL-6, Tat activated the cytokine expression by binding to the TAR-like stem loop of the 5' transcript, thus likely promoting the transcriptional elongation (33,37,47).
('Tat', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-6'),('Tat', 'Transcription', 'IL-6'),('Tat', 'Gene_expression', 'TNF-alpha'),('Tat', 'Transcription', 'TNF-alpha')

Here, we have shown that the Tat-dependent transcriptional activation of a number of pro-inflammatory genes required the assembly of Tat with p65 at the NF-kappaB enhancer together with the displacement of IkappaB-alpha (Figure 5).
('p65', 'Binding', 'Tat'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'IkappaB-alpha'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'Tat'),('Tat', 'Negative_regulation', 'p65')

Thus, in the set of distinct NF-kappaB-responsive genes, Tat acted as a component of the transcriptional initiation complex, which is consistent with previous reports on Tat promoting the transcription via DNA motifs (72,73).
('Tat', 'Binding', 'Tat')

The evidence that Tat activates NF-kappaB through direct interaction with IkappaB-alpha and p65 may lead to specific inhibitors to counteract the Tat pro-inflammatory action.

The tax protein of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 mediates the transactivation of the c-sis/platelet-derived growth factor-B promoter through interactions with the zinc finger transcription factors Sp1 and NGFI-A/Egr-1.
('tax', 'Positive_regulation', 'c-sis')

Transcriptional up-regulation of the c-sis/platelet-derived growth factor-B (PDGF-B) proto-oncogene by the Tax protein of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 has been implicated as one possible mechanism of cellular transformation by human T-cell leukemia virus type 1.
('Tax', 'Transcription', 'c-sis')

In previous work, we identified an essential site in the c-sis/PDGF-B promoter, Tax-responsive element 1 (TRE1), necessary for transactivation by Tax.
('Tax', 'Transcription', 'c-sis')

We also identified Sp1, Sp3, and NGFI-A/Egr-1 as the primary nuclear transcription factors binding to TRE1 which mediate Tax responsiveness.
('Tax', 'Binding', 'Sp1'),('Tax', 'Binding', 'NGFI-A')

In the present work, we have investigated the mechanism(s) whereby Tax transactivates the c-sis/PDGF-B proto-oncogene.
('Tax', 'Transcription', 'c-sis')

In vitro transcription assays showed that Tax was able to significantly increase the transcriptional activity of a template containing the -257 to +74 region of the c-sis/PDGF-B promoter.
('Tax', 'Transcription', 'c-sis')

Electrophoretic mobility shift assay analysis showed that Tax increased the DNA binding activity of both Sp1 and NGFI-A/Egr-1 using a TRE1 probe.
('Tax', 'Binding', 'Sp1'),('Tax', 'Binding', 'NGFI-A')

Analysis of Tax mutants showed that two mutants, IEXC29S and IEXL320G, were unable to significantly transactivate the c-sis/PDGF-B promoter.
('Tax', 'Transcription', 'c-sis')

Finally, co-immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that Tax is able to stably bind to both Sp1 and NGFI-A/Egr-1.
('Tax', 'Binding', 'Sp1'),('Tax', 'Binding', 'NGFI-A')

Interestingly, co-immunoprecipitation analysis also revealed that Tax mutant IEXC29S is unable to interact with NGFI-A/Egr-1, whereas Tax mutant IEXL320G is able to interact with NGFI-A/Egr-1.
('Tax', 'Binding', 'NGFI-A')

Luciferase assays revealed a ~20-fold increased transcriptional activity of the 1025 bp sequence as compared to the empty vector, indicating that we had identified an active A3G promoter sequence (Figure 3B).

Thrombin and thrombin receptor agonist peptide induce early events of T cell activation and synergize with TCR cross-linking for CD69 expression and interleukin 2 production.
('Thrombin', 'Gene_expression', 'CD69'),('Thrombin', 'Gene_expression', 'interleukin 2')

Tat activates the p65-dependent expression of NF-kappaB-responsive genes by occupying the NF-kappaB enhancers and promoting the p65 recruitment with IkappaB-alpha displacement.
('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65')

HeLa cells (5 x 106) were transfected with p3xFLAG-Tat, p3xFLAG-Tat C(22,25,27), p3xFLAG-Tat R(49-57) or empty vector (10 microg); for p65 RNA interference, cells (5 x 106) were transfected with p3xFLAG-Tat (10 microg) and siRNA p65 or siRNA control (200 pmol).
('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65')

(H) HeLa cells (5 x 106) were transfected with p3xFLAG-Tat, or empty vector (10 microg) and 48 h later ChIP was performed with anti-p65 antibody.
('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65')

(I) HeLa cells (5 x 106) were transfected with empty vector, or p3xFLAG-Tat (10 microg) in presence or absence of siRNA p65, or siRNA control (200 pmol); 48 h later, ChIP was performed with anti-FLAG antibody.
('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65')

Indeed, when Tax is coexpressed with the E2F-1 transcription factor in CEM T-cells, which lack expression of p16(INK4A), it strongly potentiates the E2F-dependent activation of a reporter construct driven by a promoter containing E2F binding sites.
('Tax', 'Transcription', 'E2F-1')

In addition, Tax also stimulates the transcription of the E2F-1 gene itself.
('Tax', 'Transcription', 'E2F-1')

Using Tax mutants that fail to activate either ATF- or NF-kappaB-dependent promoters and different 5' truncation mutants of the E2F-1 promoter, we show that the Tax-dependent transcriptional control of the E2F1 gene involves, at least in part, the ATF binding site located in the E2F-1 promoter.
('Tax', 'Transcription', 'E2F-1')

Extracellular-regulated kinase 1/2, Jun N-terminal kinase, and c-Jun are involved in NF-kappa B-dependent IL-6 expression in human monocytes.
('c-Jun', 'Transcription', 'IL-6')

In the present study we investigated the possible involvement of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family members extracellular-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) in mediating IL-6 gene expression in human monocytes, in particular their role in enhancing NF-kappa B activity.
('c-Jun', 'Transcription', 'IL-6'),('JNK', 'Phosphorylation', 'c-Jun')

By using PD98059, we demonstrated that the Raf1/MEK1/ERK1/2 pathway did not affect the DNA binding of NF-kappa B but, rather, acted at the level of transcriptional activity of NF-kappa B. Interestingly, it was shown that NF-kappa B-mediated gene transcription, both in the context of the IL-6 promoter as well as on its own, was dependent on both serine kinase activity and interaction with c-Jun protein.
('c-Jun', 'Transcription', 'IL-6')

Our results suggest that the JNK pathway may regulate NF-kappa B-mediated gene transcription through its phosphorylation and activation of c-Jun.

Functional inactivation of Foxp3 by genetic mutations affecting the Foxp3 coding region, as demonstrated in IPEX, or repression of Foxp3 expression by the HTLV-I-encoded transactivator protein Tax, as recently reported in patients with HAM/TSP, results in loss of regulatory activity in CD4+CD25hi T cells [4,8,17].
('Foxp3', 'Localization', 'Foxp3'),('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'Foxp3'),('Foxp3', 'Negative_regulation', 'Foxp3'),('Tax', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3')

Although it is clear that Foxp3 regulates T cell proliferation and cytokine production, very little is known concerning the molecular mechanisms of Foxp3 function.
('Foxp3', 'Localization', 'Foxp3'),('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'Foxp3'),('Foxp3', 'Negative_regulation', 'Foxp3')

The first evidence to indicate how Foxp3 promotes the development and function of regulatory T cells came from a report by Ziegler and colleagues [16], which suggested that Foxp3 could inhibit transcriptional activation by physically interacting with forkhead binding sites located immediately adjacent to critical cis-acting NF-AT binding sites found in various cytokine promoters (e.g., IL-2 promoter).
('Foxp3', 'Localization', 'Foxp3'),('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'Foxp3'),('Foxp3', 'Negative_regulation', 'Foxp3'),('Foxp3', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-2')

A recent study by Bettelli and colleagues [15] further demonstrated that Foxp3 could inhibit NF-AT as well as NF-kappaB activation, although the mechanism of suppression was shown to involve direct protein-protein interactions between NF-AT or NF-kappaB and Foxp3 rather than binding of Foxp3 to promoter elements adjacent to cis-acting NF-AT or NF-kappaB sites.
('Foxp3', 'Localization', 'Foxp3'),('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'Foxp3'),('Foxp3', 'Negative_regulation', 'Foxp3')

In the present study, we expanded upon these observations by defining additional requirements of Foxp3-mediated repression of NF-kappaB activation, and investigated whether Foxp3 could target additional signaling pathways by examining transcriptional activation of NF-kappaB-dependent and NF-kappaB-independent retroviral pathogens.
('Foxp3', 'Localization', 'Foxp3'),('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'Foxp3'),('Foxp3', 'Negative_regulation', 'Foxp3')

The characterization of the molecular targets of Foxp3 and the mechanism(s) utilized by Foxp3 to support Treg development and function will aid in our understanding of the role Tregs play in the pathogenesis of human autoimmune disease.

Addition of phosphorothioate oligonucleotides that contained the octamer consensus to Jurkat T leukemia cells inhibited interleukin-2 (IL-2) secretion to a degree similar to that observed with a mutated octamer site in the IL-2 enhancer.

Overexpression of HSF2-beta inhibits hemin-induced heat shock gene expression and erythroid differentiation in K562 cells.
('HSF2-beta', 'Positive_regulation', 'HSF2')

Previous studies revealed that HSF2 consists of two alternatively spliced isoforms, HSF2-alpha and HSF2-beta, whose relative abundance is developmentally regulated and varies between different tissues.
('HSF2-beta', 'Positive_regulation', 'HSF2'),('HSF2-alpha', 'Positive_regulation', 'HSF2')

To investigate whether the molar ratio of HSF2-alpha and HSF2-beta isoforms is crucial for the activation of HSF2 and whether the HSF2 isoforms play functionally distinct roles during the hemin-mediated erythroid differentiation, we generated cell clones expressing different levels of HSF2-alpha and HSF2-beta.
('HSF2-beta', 'Positive_regulation', 'HSF2'),('HSF2-alpha', 'Positive_regulation', 'HSF2')

We show that in parental K562 cells, the HSF2-alpha isoform is predominantly expressed and HSF2 can be activated upon hemin treatment.
('HSF2-alpha', 'Positive_regulation', 'HSF2')

In contrast, when HSF2-beta is expressed at levels exceeding those of endogenous HSF2-alpha, the hemin-induced DNA binding activity and transcription of heat shock genes are repressed, whereas overexpression of HSF2-alpha results in an enhanced hemin response.
('HSF2-beta', 'Positive_regulation', 'HSF2'),('HSF2-alpha', 'Positive_regulation', 'HSF2')

Furthermore, the hemin-induced accumulation of globin, known as a marker of erythroid differentiation, is decreased in cells overexpressing HSF2-beta.
('HSF2-beta', 'Positive_regulation', 'HSF2')

We suggest that HSF2-beta acts as a negative regulator of HSF2 activity during hemin-mediated erythroid differentiation of K562 cells.
('HSF2-beta', 'Positive_regulation', 'HSF2')

GABP factors bind to a distal interleukin 2 (IL-2) enhancer and contribute to c-Raf-mediated increase in IL-2 induction.
('c-Raf', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-2')

We show here that c-Raf, which is at the helm of the classic MAP-Erk cascade, contributes to IL-2 induction through a distal enhancer element spanning the nucleotides from positions -502 to -413 in front of the transcriptional start site of the IL-2 gene.
('c-Raf', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-2')

In conjunction with previously published data on c-Raf-induced phosphorylation of GABP factors (E.Flory, A. Hoffmeyer, U.Smola, U.R.Rapp, and J.T.Bruder, J.Virol.70:2260- 2268, 1996), these results indicate a contribution of GABP factors to the Raf-mediated enhancement of IL-2 induction during T-cell activation.

The Transactivation Functions of HTLV-I Tax Are Suppressed by Foxp3
('Foxp3', 'Transcription', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

Since the HTLV-I Tax protein can function at multiple levels in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus to stimulate activation of NF-kappaB [28,29], we hypothesized that overexpression of Foxp3 may interfere with this process.
('Foxp3', 'Transcription', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

However, since Tax-dependent HTLV-I gene expression is independent of NF-kappaB [18], we also hypothesized that Foxp3 would not affect Tax-dependent activation of the HTLV-I LTR.
('Foxp3', 'Transcription', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

To test these hypotheses, we overexpressed HTLV-I Tax, full-length Foxp3, and/or DeltaFKH in HEK 293T cells cotransfected with an HTLV-I LTR or NF-kappaB reporter vector.
('DeltaFKH', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Transcription', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

Interestingly, overexpression of Foxp3, but not DeltaFKH, suppressed Tax-mediated activation of NF-kappaB-dependent transcription.
('DeltaFKH', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Transcription', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

These observations further suggest that the carboxyl-terminal FKH domain is required for inhibiting activation of NF-kappaB in the presence of Tax in HEK 293T cells, strikingly similar to the requirements of Foxp3 inhibition of basal NF-kappaB activation shown in Figure 2B.
('Foxp3', 'Transcription', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

Transactivation of the HTLV-I LTR was stimulated about 55-fold by overexpression of Tax (Figure 4B), while transfection of Foxp3 suppressed Tax-dependent HTLV-I LTR activation, although HTLV-I LTR activation in the presence or absence of Tax is independent of NF-kappaB or NF-AT (another transcriptional activator known to interact with Foxp3).
('Foxp3', 'Transcription', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

Furthermore, overexpression of DeltaFKH also led to suppression of HTLV-I transactivation by Tax to a similar extent as full-length Foxp3 (Figure 4B).
('DeltaFKH', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Transcription', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

The suppressive effects shown in Figure 4A and 4B were not the result of Foxp3 down-regulating the expression of the transfected Tax plasmid as determined by real-time RT-PCR (Figure 4C).
('Foxp3', 'Transcription', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

These results strongly suggest that Foxp3 interacts with transcriptional regulators in addition to NF-kappaB and NF-AT, and that the carboxyl-terminal FKH domain, and therefore localization to the nucleus, are not required for inhibition of Tax-mediated HTLV-I LTR activation (even in HEK 293T cells).
('Foxp3', 'Transcription', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

To determine whether Foxp3 inhibited the transactivation functions of Tax by directly associating with this viral protein, we generated an expression vector in which HTLV-I Tax was fused in-frame to the carboxyl terminus of the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (Gal4-BD).
('Foxp3', 'Transcription', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

Transactivation of the Gal4-resposive promoter by Gal4-BD-Tax remained relatively unaffected by overexpression of either EGFP (control), Foxp3, or DeltaFKH, suggesting that Foxp3 does not repress Tax transactivation by directly interfacing with the HTLV-I Tax protein.
('DeltaFKH', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Transcription', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

As illustrated in Figure 5, the level of Tax mRNA synthesized from ACH was down-regulated in the presence of Foxp3 compared to the level produced in the presence of the control vector.
('Foxp3', 'Transcription', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

DeltaFKH did not have a discernable affect on Tax expression.
('DeltaFKH', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

These data indicate that Foxp3 is capable of repressing the expression of Tax from an infectious HTLV-I molecular clone.

Unlike published studies with pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate, which specifically inhibited vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), NAC inhibited IL-1 beta-induced mRNA and cell surface expression of both E-selectin and VCAM-1.

Itk, a T cell-specific tyrosine kinase, is required for CD2-mediated interleukin-2 promoter activation in the human T cell line Jurkat.
('Itk', 'Positive_regulation', 'interleukin-2'),('CD2', 'Phosphorylation', 'Itk')

Stimulation of either CD2 or T cell receptor (TCR)/CD3 on Tcells by monoclonal antibody-mediated cross-linking induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Itk, which was maximal as early as 1 min after stimulation.
('CD2', 'Phosphorylation', 'Itk')

Interleukin-2 (IL-2) promoter activity stimulated by cross-linking of CD2, TCR/CD3, and CD28 with antibodies was significantly reduced by transient expression of an Itk mutant lacking the kinase activity.

These results demonstrate that Itk plays a role in IL-2 production, indicating a critical involvement of Itk in the initial stage of T cell activation by mediating signals from the TCR/CD3 complex, CD2, and CD28.
('CD2', 'Positive_regulation', 'CD2'),('CD2', 'Phosphorylation', 'Itk'),('Itk', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2')

Consistent with these findings the dominant negative PKCalpha constructs also inhibited NF-kappaB p65 phosphorylation at Ser276 but not at Ser536 resulting in reduced NF-kappaB transcriptional activation and M-CSF-induced MDM survival.
('PKCalpha', 'Phosphorylation', 'p65'),('dominant negative PKCalpha', 'Phosphorylation', 'p65')

Finally, in a NF-kappaB p65-/- fibroblast cell line, we confirmed that the Ser276 residue of NF-kappaB p65 is important and essential for PKC modulation of NF-kappaB activity.
('p65', 'Binding', 'p65'),('p65', 'Positive_regulation', 'p65')

Notably, in addition to phosphorylating Ser276 of NF-kappaB, our study revealed that M-CSF also modulated the phosphorylation of the NF-kappaB p65 subunit at Ser536, however, PKC inhibitors or kinase deficient PKCalpha constructs did not affect this phosphorylation event.
('PKCalpha', 'Phosphorylation', 'p65')

Moreover, mutant constructs containing a point mutation at Ser536 of NF-kappaB p65 did not reduce NF-kappaB activity in cells lacking endogenous NF-kappaB p65, while the NF-kappaB p65 276S/A construct did reduce NF-kappaB activity in these cells.
('p65', 'Binding', 'p65'),('p65', 'Positive_regulation', 'p65')

It is notable that M-CSF activated NF-kappaB p65 Ser276 phosphorylation and transcriptional activation in a PKCalpha-dependent manner.
('PKCalpha', 'Phosphorylation', 'p65')

In our studies using conventional PKC inhibitors and dominant negative PKCalpha constructs, PKCalpha was critical in M-CSF-induced macrophage survival by inducing Ser276 phosphorylation of NF-kappaB p65 in both primary human MDMs and Raw 264.7 cells.
('PKCalpha', 'Phosphorylation', 'p65'),('dominant negative PKCalpha', 'Phosphorylation', 'p65')

It has been shown that phosphorylation of p65 at Ser276 prevents its degradation by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis and promotes cell survival in HeLa cells [24].
('ubiquitin', 'Protein_catabolism', 'p65')

We did not find that PKC was involved in IkappaBalpha degradation or NF-kappaB p65 nuclear translocation induced by M-CSF, but that M-CSF-induced phosphorylation of NF-kappaB p65 at Ser276 was dramatically reduced by the conventional PKC inhibitor and kinase deficient PKCalpha and by siRNA towards PKCalpha.
('p65', 'Binding', 'p65'),('PKCalpha', 'Phosphorylation', 'p65'),('p65', 'Positive_regulation', 'p65')

During this process, expression of IKKalpha among other proteins, is elevated leading to increased p52 NF-kappaB (relB) expression through partial proteolytic degradation of the p100 NF-kappaB protein.

Functional roles of the transcription factor Oct-2A and the high mobility group protein I/Y in HLA-DRA gene expression.
('I/Y', 'Binding', 'Oct-2A')

Here we show that the lymphoid-specific transcription factor Oct-2A plays a critical role in HLA-DRA gene expression in class II-positive B cell lines, and that the high mobility group protein (HMG) I/Y binds to multiple sites within the DRA promoter, including the Oct-2A binding site.
('I/Y', 'Binding', 'Oct-2A')

Coexpression of HMG I/Y and Oct-2 in cell lines lacking Oct-2 results in high levels of HLA-DRA gene expression, and in vitro DNA-binding studies reveal that HMG I/Y stimulates Oct-2A binding to the HLA-DRA promoter.
('I/Y', 'Binding', 'Oct-2A')

Thus, Oct-2A and HMG I/Y may synergize to activate HLA-DRA expression in B cells.
('I/Y', 'Binding', 'Oct-2A')

By contrast, Oct-2A is not involved in the IFN-gamma induction of the HLA-DRA gene in HeLa cells, but antisense HMG I/Y dramatically decreases the level of induction.
('I/Y', 'Binding', 'Oct-2A')

Transcriptional regulation of lysosomal acid lipase in differentiating monocytes is mediated by transcription factors Sp1 and AP-2.
('Sp1', 'Regulation', 'lysosomal acid lipase')

Gel mobility shift assays demonstrated that binding of Sp1 and AP-2 to the LAL promoter is increased by PMA in THP-1 cells.
('Sp1', 'Gene_expression', 'LAL')

Co-transfections with expression plasmids for Sp1 and AP-2 further emphasized the important role of these transcription factors in both basal and PMA-enhanced LAL expression.
('Sp1', 'Gene_expression', 'LAL')

Our data suggest that differentiation dependent increase of lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) expression in THP-1 cells is mediated by a concerted action of Sp1 and AP-2.

PPARgamma activation induces the expression of the adipocyte fatty acid binding protein gene in human monocytes.
('PPARgamma', 'Gene_expression', 'adipocyte fatty acid binding protein')

PPARgamma induces the expression of many genes involved in lipid anabolism, including the adipocyte fatty acid binding protein (aP2), and is a key regulator of adipocyte differentiation.
('PPARgamma', 'Gene_expression', 'adipocyte fatty acid binding protein'),('PPARgamma', 'Gene_expression', 'aP2')

We report that both natural and synthetic PPARgamma agonists induce time- and dose-dependent increases in aP2 mRNA in both primary human monocytes and the monocytic cell line, THP-1.

The mutant, containing a serine-to-alanine substitution in the DNA-binding domain of the protein, bound to several known ZEBRA-binding sites and activated transcription from reporters bearing known ZEBRA-responsive promoters but did not disrupt latency in EBV-infected cell lines.
('ZEBRA', 'Binding', 'ZEBRA')

Therefore, initiation of the EBV lytic cycle by the ZEBRA protein requires a function in addition to transcriptional activation; a change of serine 186 to alanine in the DNA-binding domain of ZEBRA abolished this additional function and uncovered a new role for the ZEBRA protein in disruption of EBV latency.

CD40 expression was confirmed in 7 human MM cell lines established from immunogenic primary tumors or metastases, whereas 11 cell lines established from advanced stages were CD40 negative.
('CD40', 'Gene_expression', 'CD40')

CD40 ligation on MM by CD40L-transfected murine L-cells or by a soluble CD40L fusion protein up-regulated their expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and MHC class I and class II molecules and their secretion of IL-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor-a, and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor and also induced a rapid activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappaB.

Runx3 controls multiple aspects of the CTL differentiation program, in part through induction of Eomes
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'Eomes'),('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'Eomes')

Strikingly, Runx3-/- CD8+ T cells were strongly impaired in their ability to differentiate into effector CTLs, as judged by expression of perforin, granzyme B, and IFN-gamma (Fig.
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'granzyme B'),('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'granzyme B'),('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'perforin')

Compared with WT T cells, perforin mRNA and protein expression were essentially undetectable in Runx3-/- T cells at day 6 of culture (Fig.
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'perforin')

Runx3-/- T cells also had no detectable Eomes expression; in contrast, T-bet expression was unimpaired (Fig.
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'Eomes'),('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'Eomes')

Furthermore, Runx3 was required for maximal production of IFN-gamma, but not TNF or IL-2, by CD8+ T cells restimulated at day 6 (Fig.
('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'TNF')

We previously reported that Th1 cell differentiation was regulated through a feed-forward loop in which T-bet is up-regulated early and induces Runx3, after which T-bet and Runx3 cooperate to induce IFN-gamma and silence IL-4, thus promoting stable differentiation toward the Th1 lineage (15, 22).
('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma')

Because (a) Runx3 appeared necessary for Eomes induction (Fig.
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'Eomes'),('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'Eomes')

3 A), (b) the kinetics of Eomes expression paralleled those of perforin expression (Fig.
('Eomes', 'Transcription', 'perforin'),('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin')

2), and (c) overexpression of Eo-VP16 in either WT or T-bet-deficient T cells led to an increase in both perforin and IFN-gamma expression (Fig.
('Eo-VP16', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin')

Specifically, we asked whether Runx3, which was necessary for Eomes induction, then cooperated with Eomes to regulate transcription of the effector CTL markers perforin, IFN-gamma, and granzyme B.
('Eomes', 'Transcription', 'IFN-gamma'),('Eomes', 'Transcription', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'granzyme B'),('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'Eomes'),('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'Eomes'),('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'granzyme B'),('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'granzyme B'),('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'perforin'),('Eomes', 'Transcription', 'granzyme B')

To test this hypothesis, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays to ask whether Eomes and Runx3 bound regulatory regions of the Prf1, Ifng, and Gzmb genes (Fig.
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'Eomes'),('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'Eomes')

Runx3 bound to the Prf1 and Gzmb transcription start sites (TSS); to a known IL-2 responsive enhancer located near -1 kb of the Prf1 gene (23); to the distal CTL-specific DNase I hypersensitive site 9 in the Prf1 locus (24); to the Ifng promoter near the TSS, as previously reported for Th1 cells (10); and to several DNase I hypersensitive sites in the Ifng locus (Fig.
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2')

To determine whether Runx3 controlled the expression of CTL effector genes through its induction of Eomes, we retrovirally expressed Runx3 and Eo-VP16 in CD8+ T cells from Runx3-/- mice.
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'Eomes'),('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'Eomes')

Reconstitution of Runx3-/- CD8+ T cells with Runx3 restored expression of Eomes as well as perforin, granzyme B, and IFN-gamma (Fig.
('Eomes', 'Transcription', 'IFN-gamma'),('Eomes', 'Transcription', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'granzyme B'),('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'Eomes'),('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'Eomes'),('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'granzyme B'),('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'granzyme B'),('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'perforin'),('Eomes', 'Transcription', 'granzyme B')

Notably, Eo-VP16 did not up-regulate perforin expression when expressed in Runx3-/- cells, even though it restored the capacity to induce IFN-gamma expression upon TCR restimulation (Fig.
('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'IFN-gamma'),('Eo-VP16', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'perforin')

This result suggests strongly that perforin expression requires Runx3 and Eomes.
('Eomes', 'Transcription', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'Eomes'),('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'Eomes'),('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'perforin')

As expected from their defect in perforin and granzyme B expression, Runx3-/- CD8+ T cells showed defective cytolytic activity in a mixed lymphocyte reaction (12).
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'granzyme B'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'granzyme B'),('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'perforin')

Therefore, although activation of the perforin/granzyme B machinery is defective in Runx3-/- CD8+ cells, these cells are not entirely devoid of cytolytic activity and could still effectively kill targets, possibly by alternative mechanisms such as the Fas-Fas ligand pathway.

Using an in vitro competition assay (Figure 4A) utilizing purified activated GATA-3, importin-alpha, and activated GR, we demonstrated that activated GR significantly increased GR-importin-alpha association in the presence and absence of activated GATA-3 (Figure 4B).
('GR', 'Localization', 'GATA-3'),('GR', 'Binding', 'GR'),('GATA-3', 'Binding', 'GR'),('GR', 'Binding', 'GATA-3')

This effect is not mutual, since activated GATA-3 did not block GR-importin-alpha association (Figure 4C).
('GR', 'Localization', 'GATA-3'),('GATA-3', 'Binding', 'GR'),('GR', 'Binding', 'GATA-3')

These data also suggest that both activated GR and phospho-GATA-3 can directly associate with importin-alpha (Figure 4D) and that activated GR attenuates the phospho-GATA-3/importin-alpha interaction in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 4E).
('GR', 'Localization', 'GATA-3'),('GR', 'Binding', 'GR'),('GATA-3', 'Binding', 'GR'),('GR', 'Binding', 'GATA-3')

Together, this suggests that ligand-activated GR may compete with phospho-GATA-3 for importin-alpha and thereby limit GATA-3 nuclear import.
('GR', 'Localization', 'GATA-3'),('GATA-3', 'Binding', 'GR'),('GR', 'Binding', 'GATA-3')

Nor did addition of FP subsequent to anti-CD3/CD28 nuclear translocation affect GATA-3 nuclear residency (Figure 5C), suggesting that activated GR does not enhance GATA-3 nuclear export.
('GR', 'Localization', 'GATA-3'),('GATA-3', 'Binding', 'GR'),('GR', 'Binding', 'GATA-3')

Using this system, we observed that CD28 stimulation by B7-transfected CHO cells induced a proliferative response in T cells that was not accompanied by measurable IL-2 production.
('CD28', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2')

In contrast, engagement of the TCR by class II MHC/superantigen, either with or without CD28 ligation, resulted in the induction of NF-AT, AP-1, and NF-kappaB as well as IL-2 production.
('CD28', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2')

Perforin and granzyme B expression are not appreciably regulated by T-bet
('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'granzyme B'),('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'Perforin')

To test the model outlined in the previous paragraph directly, we compared the expression of IFN-gamma, perforin, and granzyme B in CD8+ T cells from WT and Tbx21 (T-bet)-deficient mice.
('T-bet', 'Transcription', 'perforin'),('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'granzyme B'),('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma')

In contrast, T-bet-deficient T cells cultured for 6 d showed no defect in perforin mRNA expression (Fig.
('T-bet', 'Transcription', 'perforin')

We consistently observed a modest reduction in GzmB mRNA in T-bet-deficient T cells (Fig.
('T-bet', 'Transcription', 'GzmB'),('T-bet', 'Negative_regulation', 'GzmB')

Eo-VP16, but not the empty GFP retrovirus, increased perforin expression in both WT and T-bet-deficient CD8+ T cells (Fig.
('T-bet', 'Transcription', 'perforin'),('Eo-VP16', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin')

As expected, Eo-VP16 also rescued the early defect in IFN-gamma production observed in T-bet-deficient CD8+ T cells (Fig.
('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma')

However, Eo-VP16 did not induce GzmB mRNA expression in either WT or T-bet-deficient cells; thus, the partial T-bet dependence of GzmB mRNA expression cannot be compensated for by Eo-VP16.

IKKbeta phosphorylates RPS3 at serine 209
('IKKbeta', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3')

We therefore hypothesized that IKKbeta could directly phosphorylate RPS3.
('IKKbeta', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3')

By in vitro kinase assays using recombinant IKK and RPS3 proteins, we observed strong incorporation of 32P in autophosphorylatd IKKalpha and IKKbeta (Fig.
('IKKbeta', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3')

We discovered that GST-RPS3 could be phosphorylated by IKKbeta, but not IKKalpha, in vitro (Fig.
('IKKbeta', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3')

To identify the RPS3 amino acid residue(s) phosphorylated by IKKbeta, we performed liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analyses using in vitro phosphorylated RPS3.
('IKKbeta', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('RPS3', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3')

The results indicated that IKKbeta phosphorylated S209, located in the RPS3 C-terminus (Fig.
('IKKbeta', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3')

To verify biochemically that S209 is an IKKbeta substrate, we performed 32P-labeling in vitro kinase assays with recombinant wild-type or S209A mutant RPS3 proteins.
('IKKbeta', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3')

Compared with the wild-type protein, the S209A mutation reduced IKKbeta-mediated RPS3 phosphorylation (Fig.
('IKKbeta', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3')

Thus, RPS3 S209 phosphorylation was due to the alternate specificity of the IKKbeta kinase rather than any trace amount of CK2 bound to IKKs.
('IKKbeta', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3')

To determine whether S209 is the critical site at which IKKbeta phosphorylates RPS3 in living cells, we transfected the wild-type or S209A mutant Flag-RPS3 alone, or together with IKKbeta into cells.
('IKKbeta', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('RPS3', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('IKKbeta', 'Phosphorylation', 'Flag-RPS3')

Indeed, we observed that overexpressing IKKbeta enhanced Flag-RPS3 phosphorylation, but phosphorylation was effectively eliminated by alanine substitution indicating that S209 is the predominant target site for IKKbeta phosphorylation (Fig.
('IKKbeta', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('IKKbeta', 'Phosphorylation', 'Flag-RPS3')

We next generated a phospho-S209 RPS3 antibody and confirmed that endogenous RPS3 was phosphorylated at S209 in a time-dependent manner upon TNF stimulation (Fig.
('RPS3', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3')

HOIP is necessary for association of the IKK complex with CD40
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40')

The marked defects in CD40-mediated cell activation and signaling displayed by HOIP-deficient cells suggested that HOIP mediates recruitment of critical components of the CD40 signaling apparatus to the receptor.
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40')

Previously, we demonstrated that HOIP is recruited to the CD40 signaling complex in a TRAF2-dependent manner, suggesting that HOIP functions downstream of TRAF2 [6].
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40'),('HOIP', 'Binding', 'TRAF2'),('TRAF2', 'Binding', 'HOIP')

Studies by others suggest that the TRAF2-associated proteins cIAP1 and cIAP2 play a role in the recruitment of HOIP to TNFR1 and CD40 [14].
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'cIAP1'),('cIAP2', 'Binding', 'HOIP'),('cIAP1', 'Binding', 'HOIP'),('cIAP', 'Binding', 'HOIP'),('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40'),('HOIP', 'Binding', 'TRAF2'),('TRAF2', 'Binding', 'HOIP'),('cIAP', 'Protein_modification', 'HOIP')

Therefore, we determined whether the association of HOIP with CD40 in A20.2J cells was altered by treatment of cells with an inhibitor of cIAP activity, a membrane-permeable peptide derived from the apoptosis regulator SMAC [15].
('cIAP', 'Binding', 'HOIP'),('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40'),('cIAP', 'Protein_modification', 'HOIP')

SMAC peptide treatment also resulted in a slight but reproducible decrease in the amount of the major HOIP form recovered by CD40 immunoprecipitation, along with an apparent increase in higher molecular weight species recognized by anti-HOIP antibody.
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40')

These data suggest that SMAC peptide treatment specifically alters the characteristics of CD40-associated HOIP rather than the entire cellular pool of this protein.
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40')

Together, these results support the idea that the cIAP proteins influence the recruitment and post-translational modification state of CD40-associated HOIP.
('cIAP', 'Binding', 'HOIP'),('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40'),('cIAP', 'Protein_modification', 'HOIP')

To test the possibility that HOIP is responsible for the recruitment of other critical signaling proteins to CD40, we immunoprecipitated CD40 signaling complexes from HOIP-deficient and HOIP-reconstituted cells (Fig.
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40')

As described previously, CD40 signaling complexes immunoprecipitated from A20.2J cells contained HOIP as well as TRAF2, TRAF3, IKKalpha/beta, and IKKgamma [6].
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'TRAF3'),('HOIP', 'Binding', 'IKKgamma'),('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40'),('HOIP', 'Binding', 'TRAF2'),('TRAF2', 'Binding', 'HOIP')

The amounts of TRAF2, TRAF3, and cIAP1 in CD40 immunoprecipitates from HOIP-deficient cells were similar to those from parental A20.2J cells, indicating that HOIP is not required for the association of these proteins with CD40.
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'cIAP1'),('HOIP', 'Binding', 'TRAF3'),('cIAP1', 'Binding', 'HOIP'),('cIAP', 'Binding', 'HOIP'),('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40'),('HOIP', 'Binding', 'TRAF2'),('TRAF2', 'Binding', 'HOIP'),('cIAP', 'Protein_modification', 'HOIP')

In contrast, IKKalpha/beta and IKKgamma were not detectable in CD40 immunoprecipitates recovered from HOIP-deficient cells (Fig.
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'IKKgamma'),('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40')

The amounts of IKKalpha/beta and IKKgamma in CD40 immunoprecipitates from HOIP-reconstituted cells were similar to those detected in samples prepared from parental cells, demonstrating that the defects in IKK recruitment we observed were due specifically to the absence of HOIP expression.
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'IKKgamma'),('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40')

These data indicate that HOIP is required for recruitment of the NF-kappaB-activating complex to the CD40 signaling complex.
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40')

To confirm that this higher molecular weight species was indeed IKKgamma, we generated A20.2J cell lines containing a stably integrated retroviral vector that encoded an epitope-tagged version of mouse IKKgamma.
('IKKgamma', 'Protein_modification', 'IKKgamma')

Moreover, analysis of cells expressing epitope tagged-IKKgamma confirmed that recruitment of IKKgamma to CD40 requires HOIP.
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'IKKgamma'),('IKKgamma', 'Protein_modification', 'IKKgamma'),('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40')

Overall, these data demonstrate that HOIP is required for the association of IKKgamma with CD40, and suggest that this event is coupled to post-translational modifications of IKKgamma.
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'IKKgamma'),('IKKgamma', 'Protein_modification', 'IKKgamma'),('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40')

The T-box transcription factors T-bet and Eomes have been linked to the regulation of genes encoding effector cytokines (e.g., Ifng) and genes important for cytolytic function (e.g., Prf1 and GzmB) (20).
('Eomes', 'Regulation', 'Prf1'),('Eomes', 'Regulation', 'Ifng'),('Eomes', 'Regulation', 'GzmB'),('T-bet', 'Regulation', 'GzmB'),('T-bet', 'Regulation', 'Prf1'),('T-bet', 'Regulation', 'Ifng')

T-bet mRNA expression slightly preceded the expression of GzmB mRNA; similarly, Eomes mRNA and protein were expressed approximately1 d ahead of the reexpression of perforin mRNA and protein, respectively (Fig.
('Eomes', 'Regulation', 'GzmB'),('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('T-bet', 'Regulation', 'GzmB')

T-bet is required early for IFN-gamma production, and our data suggested that Eomes might not function during this early period but rather might contribute later to the control of perforin expression.
('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma')

Our data seemed most consistent with a model in which TCR signals induce T-bet, which in turn induces IFN-gamma (17) and possibly granzyme B; subsequently, Eomes is induced during the period of clonal expansion in IL-2 and activates perforin expression.

Induction of interleukin-12 p40 transcript by CD40 ligation via activation of nuclear factor-kappaB.
('CD40', 'Positive_regulation', 'p40')

Interleukin-12 is produced in response to infection with bacteria or parasites or to bacterial constituents such as LPS in monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells, and also generated by the interaction between activated T cells and antigen-presenting cells via CD40-CD40 ligand (CD40L).
('CD40', 'Positive_regulation', 'CD40')

In the present study, we have characterized the transcriptional induction of p40 by CD40 ligation in a human B lymphoblastoid cell line, Daudi, and a human acute monocytic leukemia cell line, THP-1.
('CD40', 'Positive_regulation', 'p40')

These cells, stimulated by an agonistic monoclonal antibody against CD40 or by transfection with a CD40L expression vector, secreted p40 and showed enhanced p40 mRNA expression.
('CD40', 'Positive_regulation', 'CD40'),('CD40', 'Positive_regulation', 'p40')

Electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed that the potential NF-kappaB binding sequence which is located around 120 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site in murine and human p40 genes formed an NF-kappaB complex with nuclear extract from Daudi cells stimulated by CD40 ligation.
('CD40', 'Positive_regulation', 'p40')

These results suggest that the NF-kappaB binding site located around 120 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site in murine and human p40 promoter regions could be important for the p40 induction by CD40 ligation via activation of NF-kappaB.
('CD40', 'Positive_regulation', 'p40')

TNFRI has been recently shown to activate NF-kappaB through association with TRADD, RIP, and TRAF2; activation of the NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK); activation of the IkappaB alpha kinases (IKKalpha and IKKbeta); and phosphorylation of IkappaB alpha.

IL-12 and High Doses of Antigen Induce the Development of Th1 Cells Producing IL-10
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Culture of naive CD4+ Tcells in an APC-free system by stimulation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies in the presence of IL-12 resulted in IFN-gamma-producing Th1 cells, a proportion of which coproduced IL-10, as did Th2 cells resulting from culture in IL-4 (FigureS1B).
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma')

To investigate whether the lack of IL-10 produced by Th1 cells resulted from inhibition of IL-10 production by DCs and high antigen dose or alternatively required IL-12, we cultured naive CD4+ Tcells with increasing doses of antigen presented by DC in the presence of IL-12.
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

At low doses of antigen, IL-12 abrogated the development of Th2 cells and induced IFN-gamma expression but only low levels of IL-10 expression, suggesting that IL-12 per se was not sufficient to induce significant IL-10 production in Th1 cells (Figure1A).
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma')

Strikingly, as the antigen dose was increased, Th1 populations driven with IL-12 now contained higher numbers of IL-10-producing cells (Figure1A) and produced more IL-10 protein upon restimulation (Figures 1A and 1B).
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Thus, the development of Th1 cells producing IL-10 required both IL-12 and high doses of antigen.
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Th1 cells differentiated to produce large amounts of IL-10 and IFN-gamma and lost theircapacity to produce IL-2 (Figure1B).
('IL-2', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Because the presence of IL-12 reduced the proliferation of CD4+ Tcells at both high andlow antigen doses (Table S1), and only the former showed IL-10 production, the development of high IL-10-producing cellsis most likely not related to limited IL-2.
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-2', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Naive CD4+ Tcells from DO11.10/recombination-activating gene 1 (Rag1)-deficient animals, cultured with high doses of antigen in the presence of IL-12, also resulted in IL-10 expression by Th1 cells, showing that this expression was not dependent on the presence of effector or memory Tcells or Treg cells (FigureS2).
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Although it has been suggested that TGF-beta can induce IL-10 in CD4+ Tcells (Kitani etal., 2003; Schiott etal., 2000), we found that in developing Th1 and Th2 cells this was not the case (data not shown).
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

In fact, neutralization of TGF-beta led to increased IL-10 production by both Tcell subsets (FigureS3).
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Thus, the development of IL-10-producing Th1 cells only depended on the presence of IL-12 together with high antigen dose and not on other soluble factors such as IL-2 or TGF-beta or on the presence of other Tcell types.

The presence of an active CRE site in the bcl-2 promoter implies that the regulation of bcl-2 expression is linked to a signal transduction pathway in B cells.
('bcl-2', 'Gene_expression', 'bcl-2')

The CRE site in the bcl-2 promoter appears to play a major role in the induction of bcl-2 expression during the activation of mature B cells and during the rescue of immature B cells from apoptosis.
('bcl-2', 'Gene_expression', 'bcl-2')

Furthermore, TIMP-1 upregulation induced expression of Bcl-XL but not Bcl-2 as well as decreased NF-kappaB activity as compared with controls.

In Rel-/- splenic T cell cultures stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin, the levels of IL-3, IL-5, granulocyte- macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) were only 2- to 3-fold lower compared with normal T cells.
('Rel', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-3'),('Rel', 'Gene_expression', 'GM-CSF')

Exogenous IL-2, which restitutes the proliferative response of the anti-CD3- and anti-CD28-treated Rel-/- T cells, restores production of IL-5, TNF-alpha, and IFN-gamma, but not IL-3 and GM-CSF expression to approximately normal levels.
('IL-2', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-5'),('IL-2', 'Gene_expression', 'GM-CSF'),('IL-2', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-3'),('IL-2', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('Rel', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-3'),('IL-2', 'Gene_expression', 'TNF-alpha'),('Rel', 'Gene_expression', 'GM-CSF')

In contrast to mitogen-activated Rel-/- T cells, lipopolysaccharide-stimulated Rel-/- macrophages produce higher than normal levels of GM-CSF.
('Rel', 'Gene_expression', 'GM-CSF')

These findings establish that Rel can function as an activator or repressor of gene expression and is required by T lymphocytes for production of IL-3 and GM-CSF.
('Rel', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-3'),('Rel', 'Gene_expression', 'GM-CSF')

The current study reveals that FOXP3 induction, an important step in iTreg commitment, is inhibited by GATA3, which is the key regulator for polarization toward Th2 cells.
('GATA3', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Binding', 'FOXP3')

In contrast, naive T cells could efficiently up-regulate FOXP3 when treated with TGF-beta to induce iTreg cells [10,28-34], suggesting that FOXP3 plays an important role in the early differentiation process and may act in a way similar to that known for the Th1/Th2 decision factors T-bet and GATA3.
('GATA3', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'GATA3'),('GATA3', 'Binding', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'T-bet')

In this competitive process TGF-beta appeared to be mandatory for the induction of FOXP3, possibly by keeping the expression of GATA3 and T-bet low [37,38].
('GATA3', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'GATA3'),('GATA3', 'Binding', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'T-bet')

In contrast, differentiating naive T cells in the absence of polarization factors (Th0) such as IL-4, IL-12, or TGF-beta showed only a transient FOXP3 expression and failed to generate a population of FOXP3-expressing cells, but GATA3 and T-bet were up-regulated (unpublished data).
('GATA3', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'GATA3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'GATA3'),('GATA3', 'Binding', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'T-bet')

Interestingly, as we and others previously described, FOXP3-promoting factors, such as dexamethasone [39], CTLA-4 [40], and estrogens [41], are also known as inhibitors of GATA3 expression [42-45].
('GATA3', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('CTLA-4', 'Gene_expression', 'GATA3'),('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Binding', 'FOXP3')

Therefore GATA3 not only induces differentiation into Th2 cells but also inhibits FOXP3 expression and commitment into iTreg cells.
('GATA3', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Binding', 'FOXP3')

The Th2 cytokine IL-4 but not IL-13 (unpublished data) was able to inhibit TGF-beta-mediated FOXP3 induction and therefore prevented conversion into the regulatory phenotype.
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-13', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

Only the IL-4/IL-4 mAb complex resulted in a decrease of the amount of natural or inducible Treg (CD25+ and Foxp3+) cells 7 d after treatment.
('CD25', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3')

But since a distinction of nTreg and iTreg cells is currently not possible, because iTreg cells also transiently express CD25 after activation, we cannot exclude that IL-4 may also inhibit Foxp3 expression in nTreg cells in vivo or that additional effects may contribute to the observed drop in Foxp3 expression.
('CD25', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3')

IL-4 has been previously shown to induce the generation of FOXP3+ Treg cells out of CD4+CD25- [50].
('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

In those experiments, the concentrations of IL-4 used were low, and as we also observed, IL-4 at low concentration slightly enhanced FOXP3 expression.
('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

IL-4 may favor proliferation of nTreg cells [47] or directly regulate FOXP3 expression in a STAT-dependent fashion [51].
('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

Since IL-13 does not effectively reduce FOXP3 and fails to induce GATA3, we hypothesized that the IL-4-dependent inhibition of FOXP3 could be mediated by GATA3.
('GATA3', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'GATA3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Binding', 'FOXP3'),('IL-13', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

In fact, GATA3-inducing IL-4 concentrations repressed TGF-beta-mediated FOXP3 expression, whereas IL-4 as well as TGF-beta signaling were intact.
('GATA3', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'GATA3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'GATA3'),('GATA3', 'Binding', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

This result suggested a competitive mechanism between GATA3 and FOXP3 transcription factors in determining lineage commitment during the early phase of differentiation.
('GATA3', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Binding', 'FOXP3')

Accordingly, we investigated naturally high GATA3-expressing cells and confirmed the absence of FOXP3.
('GATA3', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Binding', 'FOXP3')

Protein transduction of GATA3 into naive T cells inhibited FOXP3 induction in human, differentiating, naive T cells.
('GATA3', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Binding', 'FOXP3')

In line with the transient overexpression of GATA3 in human T cells, cells of these mice failed to induce FOXP3 expression upon exposure with antigen in the presence of TGF-beta.
('GATA3', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'GATA3'),('GATA3', 'Binding', 'FOXP3')

Strikingly, the DO11.10:CD2-GATA3 mice do have peripheral FOXP3+ cells, which however displayed a 10%-25% lower frequency compared to wild-type DO11.10 mice.
('GATA3', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Binding', 'FOXP3')

Our study demonstrates that GATA3 repressed FOXP3 expression directly by binding to the FOXP3 promoter region.
('GATA3', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Binding', 'FOXP3')

Therefore keeping GATA3 expression low might be required to induce efficient FOXP3+ iTreg cell generation.
('GATA3', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Binding', 'FOXP3')

The molecular interactions enabling GATA3 to inhibit FOXP3 are not identified yet, but the GATA-binding site is located adjacent to positive, inducing sites, composed of AP-1-NFATc2 sites [24], and GATA3 may compete with the binding of AP-1/NFAT to the promoter (unpublished observations).
('GATA3', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Binding', 'FOXP3')

In summary, we demonstrated that FOXP3 is negatively regulated by cytokines such as IL-4.
('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

GATA3 acts as an inhibitor of FOXP3 expression in early T cell differentiation, as well as in differentiated Th2 cells by directly binding and repressing the FOXP3 promoter.
('GATA3', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Binding', 'FOXP3')

We therefore describe a new mechanism of how Il-4 avoids tolerance induction by repressing FOXP3 expression.
('Il-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

We hypothesized that IL-10 prevents human monocyte NF-kappaB activation and resultant TNF-alpha production by stabilization of IkappaB-alpha.
('IL-10', 'Protein_catabolism', 'IkappaB-alpha'),('IL-10', 'Gene_expression', 'TNF-alpha')

The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of IL-10 on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced human monocyte TNF-alpha production, NF-kappaB activation, and IkappaB-alpha degradation.
('IL-10', 'Protein_catabolism', 'IkappaB-alpha'),('IL-10', 'Gene_expression', 'TNF-alpha')

IL-10 attenuated LPS-stimulated TNF-alpha production (297+/-54; p < .001 versus LPS alone).
('IL-10', 'Gene_expression', 'TNF-alpha')

IL-10 pretreatment prevented LPS-induced decreases in IkappaB-alpha protein levels and attenuated NF-kappaB DNA binding.
('IL-10', 'Protein_catabolism', 'IkappaB-alpha')

IL-10 appears to prevent activation of NF-kappaB by preserving IkappaB-alpha protein levels, leading to a reduction in TNF-alpha release.
('IL-10', 'Protein_catabolism', 'IkappaB-alpha'),('IL-10', 'Gene_expression', 'TNF-alpha')

DNA-binding properties of HIV-TF1 suggested that HIV-TF1 might be identical or related to USF.
('HIV-TF1', 'Binding', 'HIV-TF1')

Interestingly, treatment of purified HIV-TF1 by phosphatase greatly reduced its DNA-binding activity, suggesting that phosphorylation of HIV-TF1 was essential for DNA binding.
('HIV-TF1', 'Binding', 'HIV-TF1')

LMP-1 induces the expression of bcl2, an oncogene which protects cells from apoptosis, as well as of genes encoding other proteins involved in cell regulation and growth control.
('LMP-1', 'Gene_expression', 'bcl2')

The Tax protein of HTLV-I, a positive transcriptional activator of HTLV-I gene expression, is a viral oncogene that also increases transcription of cellular genes including GM-CSF, IL-2R alpha and IL-2.
('Tax', 'Transcription', 'IL-2'),('Tax', 'Transcription', 'GM-CSF'),('Tax', 'Transcription', 'IL-2R alpha')

Most importantly, we show a Tax-dependent correlation between expression of NFKB2(p100) and processing to the DNA binding NFKB2(p52) form, induction of c-Rel, and trans-activation of NF-kappa B-mediated gene expression.
('NFKB2', 'Localization', 'NFKB2')

We propose that NFKB2 synthesis and processing allows continuous nuclear expression of an otherwise cytoplasmic protein and, in conjunction with overexpression of c-Rel, NFKB2 alters the NF-kappa B signalling pathway and contributes to leukemic transformation of T cells by HTLV-I.
('NFKB2', 'Localization', 'NFKB2')

It represses Runx1 and has a positive role in the induction of Eomes, granzyme B, perforin, and IFN-gamma.
('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin')

Additional experiments are needed to determine whether Eomes and Runx1 are also direct target genes of Runx3.
('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'Eomes')

Surprisingly, Runx3 contributed to the optimal expression of TNF, IL-2, and IFN-gamma at day 4 (Fig.
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'TNF')

For TNF and IL-2, the requirement for Runx3 subsides by day 6 (Fig.
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'TNF')

Runx3 continues to be required for IFN-gamma expression even at day 6, perhaps because of its role in the induction of Eomes expression (Fig.
('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'Eomes'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'IFN-gamma')

T-bet is needed early to confer on activated CD8+ T cells the competence to produce IFN-gamma upon restimulation, but its function is less important at later times.
('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma')

Eomes, which is induced late and functions downstream of Runx3, may substitute for T-bet in promoting the acute expression of IFN-gamma in restimulated CTLs (8).
('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'Eomes'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'IFN-gamma'),('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma')

Indeed, T-bet and Eomes both contribute to perforin expression in NK cells (8, 26), and Eomes induces granzyme B as effectively as T-bet in developing Th2 cells (7); thus, the relative roles of these T-box transcription factors vary depending on cell type.
('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'granzyme B')

Surprisingly, however, Eomes and T-bet appeared nonredundant in their ability to induce two other markers of CTL function, Prf1 and Gzmb (Fig.
('Eomes', 'Positive_regulation', 'Prf1'),('T-bet', 'Positive_regulation', 'Gzmb')

Rather, T-bet and Eomes were involved in regulating granzyme B and perforin expression, respectively: up-regulation of T-bet and Eomes mRNA and protein closely preceded up-regulation of Gzmb and Prf1 mRNA and protein, respectively.
('Eomes', 'Positive_regulation', 'Prf1'),('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'granzyme B'),('T-bet', 'Positive_regulation', 'Gzmb')

T-bet had no role in perforin expression under our culture conditions, and Eo-VP16 did not affect granzyme B expression when expressed in T-bet-/- or Runx3-/- cells.
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'granzyme B'),('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'granzyme B'),('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'perforin'),('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'granzyme B'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Eo-VP16', 'Gene_expression', 'granzyme B')

Because conventional Eomes-deficient mice die before precursor cells can be isolated for bone marrow transfers (27) and because T cells conditionally deficient in Eomes have only recently been described (9), we were unable to introduce Runx3 into Eomes-deficient CD8+ T cells to test formally whether Eomes cooperated with Runx3 to induce perforin expression.
('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'Eomes'),('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin')

Collectively, our data are consistent with a transcriptional network in which preexisting Runx3 cooperates with the induced T-box factors T-bet and Eomes and IL-2Rbeta signals (unpublished data) to orchestrate CTL differentiation (Fig.
('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'Eomes'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2')

Our data recall the "feed-forward" interaction between T-bet and Runx3 that we previously described in CD4+ (Th1) T cells (15) but are distinct in two respects: in differentiating Th1 cells, T-bet is induced by TCR signals and IFN-gamma, and in turn induces Runx3 (15), whereas in differentiating CD8+ T cells, preexisting Runx3 is required to induce the T-box transcription factor Eomes.

Identification of an I kappa B alpha-associated protein kinase in a human monocytic cell line and determination of its phosphorylation sites on I kappa B alpha.
('I kappa B alpha', 'Protein_catabolism', 'I kappa B alpha')

Mutational analyses of I kappa B alpha and competition experiments with the synthetic peptides identified major phosphorylation sites by the bound kinase as Ser and Thr residues in the C-terminal acidic domain of I kappa B alpha.
('I kappa B alpha', 'Protein_catabolism', 'I kappa B alpha')

Moreover, we show that the peptide, corresponding to the C-terminal acidic domain of I kappa B alpha, blocked the LPS-induced NF-kappa B activation as well as inducible phosphorylation of endogenous I kappa B alpha in a cell-free system using THP-1 cells.
('I kappa B alpha', 'Protein_catabolism', 'I kappa B alpha')

These results suggested that the bound kinase is involved in the signaling pathway of LPS by inducing the phosphorylation of the C-terminal region of I kappa B alpha and subsequent dissociation of the NF-kappa B.I kappa B alpha complex.
('I kappa B alpha', 'Protein_catabolism', 'I kappa B alpha')

Triggering of the human interleukin-6 gene by interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in monocytic cells involves cooperation between interferon regulatory factor-1, NF kappa B, and Sp1 transcription factors.
('interferon regulatory factor-1', 'Positive_regulation', 'interleukin-6'),('Sp1', 'Positive_regulation', 'interleukin-6')

Synergistic induction of the IL-6 gene by IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha, in monocytic cells, involved cooperation between the IRF-1 and NF kappa B p65 homodimers with concomitant removal of the negative effect of the retinoblastoma control element present in the IL-6 promoter.
('IRF-1', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-6'),('p65', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-6')

This removal occurred by activation of the constitutive Sp1 factor, whose increased binding activity and phosphorylation were mediated by IFN-gamma.
('IFN-gamma', 'Phosphorylation', 'Sp1')

When the HTLV-1 tax gene was expressed or phorbol myristake acetate-A23187 stimulation was used, ICSAT expression was induced in Jurkat cells which otherwise do not express ICSAT.
('tax', 'Gene_expression', 'ICSAT')

In addition, it has been established that tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) can activate the expression of wild type p53 in concert with the nuclear transcription factor, NF-kappa B.
('TNF-alpha', 'Gene_expression', 'p53')

In this paper we shall advance the hypothesis that: (i) TNF-alpha indirectly controls immune surveillance; and (ii) TNF-alpha controls DNA repair and tumor suppression through the regulation of wild type p53.
('TNF-alpha', 'Gene_expression', 'p53')

The B cell-specific nuclear factor OTF-2 positively regulates transcription of the human class II transplantation gene, DRA.
('OTF-2', 'Transcription', 'DRA')

The promoter of the major histocompatibility class II gene DRA contains an octamer element (ATTTGCAT) that is required for efficient DRA expression in B cells.
('DRA', 'Gene_expression', 'DRA')

This report directly demonstrates that OTF-2 but not OTF-1 regulates the DRA gene.
('OTF-2', 'Transcription', 'DRA'),('OTF-1', 'Transcription', 'DRA')

In vitro transcription analysis using protein fractions enriched for the octamer-binding protein OTF-2 demonstrate a positive functional role for OTF-2 in DRA gene transcription.
('OTF-2', 'Transcription', 'DRA')

In contrast, OTF-1-enriched protein fractions did not affect DRA gene transcription although it functionally enhanced the transcription of another gene.
('OTF-1', 'Transcription', 'DRA')

Recombinant OTF-2 protein produced by in vitro transcription/translation could also enhance DRA gene transcription in vitro.
('OTF-2', 'Transcription', 'DRA')

In vivo transient transfection studies utilizing an OTF-2 expression vector resulted in similar findings: that OTF-2 protein enhanced DRA gene transcription, and that this effect requires an intact octamer element.
('OTF-2', 'Transcription', 'DRA')

Both iNO production and endothelial VCAM-1 expression were induced simultaneously with bacterial LPS and murine-specific IFN-gamma.
('IFN-gamma', 'Gene_expression', 'VCAM-1')

Inhibition of iNO synthase (iNOS) activity with N omega-monomethyl-L-arginine in endothelial-RAW264.7 cocultures, stimulated with murine-specific IFN-gamma and LPS, decreased iNO production by 86%, augmented VCAM-1 and iNOS expression in endothelial and RAW264.7 cells, respectively, and increased monocyte adhesion to the endothelial cell surface.

NleH1 inhibits RPS3 S209 phosphorylation in vivo
('NleH1', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3')

6d), we hypothesized that NleH1 blocked RPS3 S209 phosphorylation in vivo, thereby preventing RPS3 nuclear translocation in infected piglets.
('NleH1', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3')

Consistent with in vitro data, piglets infected with wild-type E. coli O157:H7 exhibited diffuse and low intensity phospho-RPS3 staining, whereas in piglets infected with deltanleH1 mutant, phospho-RPS3 expression was florid and intense (Fig.
('deltanleH1', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3')

These data demonstrate that NleH1 inhibits RPS3 S209 phosphorylation both in vitro and in vivo, which might benefit the bacterium in colonization and transmission.
('NleH1', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3')

Firstly, corticosteroid-activated GR appears to compete with activated GATA-3 for nuclear import via importin-alpha, which is required for the nuclear transport of both GATA-3 and GR.
('GATA-3', 'Binding', 'GATA-3'),('GR', 'Binding', 'GATA-3'),('GATA-3', 'Localization', 'GATA-3'),('GR', 'Localization', 'GATA-3')

We have previously shown that translocation of GATA-3 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus involves the nuclear transporter protein importin-alpha, which interacts with phosphorylated GATA-3 [12].
('GATA-3', 'Binding', 'GATA-3'),('GATA-3', 'Localization', 'GATA-3')

We have also previously reported that GATA-3 knockdown using siRNA results in suppression of anti-CD3/CD28-stimulated IL-4/IL-5 mRNA induction, thus implicating an essential role for GATA-3 in the transcription of these genes [12].
('GATA-3', 'Binding', 'GATA-3'),('GATA-3', 'Localization', 'GATA-3'),('GATA-3', 'Transcription', 'IL-5'),('GATA-3', 'Transcription', 'IL-4')

We now confirm, in human T cells, that GR also uses the same nuclear import mechanism as GATA-3 [22].
('GR', 'Binding', 'GATA-3'),('GR', 'Localization', 'GATA-3')

We therefore propose that there is competition between ligand-activated GR and phospho-GATA-3 for nuclear import.
('GR', 'Binding', 'GATA-3'),('GR', 'Localization', 'GATA-3')

Furthermore, we have shown that there is preferential binding of importin-alpha to activated GR over phospho-GATA-3, so that corticosteroids would preferentially reduce GATA-3 entry and thus rapidly switch off Th2 gene transcription without any need for any intermediate steps.
('GATA-3', 'Binding', 'GATA-3'),('GR', 'Binding', 'GATA-3'),('GATA-3', 'Localization', 'GATA-3'),('GR', 'Localization', 'GATA-3')

We tested some alternative explanations for this effect of FP on GATA-3 nuclear exclusion and failed to show that FP either enhances GATA-3 nuclear export directly or induces GATA-3 degradation.
('GATA-3', 'Binding', 'GATA-3'),('GATA-3', 'Localization', 'GATA-3')

The evidence from the in vitro competition assays does, however, suggest that purified activated GR can clearly attenuate purified phospho-GATA-3-importin-alpha association and that the converse does not occur.
('GR', 'Binding', 'GATA-3'),('GR', 'Localization', 'GATA-3')

We hypothesize that this rapid induction of MKP-1 can reduce GATA-3 nuclear import by attenuating p38 MAPK activity and subsequent GATA-3 phosphorylation, thus preventing nuclear translocation.
('GATA-3', 'Binding', 'GATA-3'),('GATA-3', 'Localization', 'GATA-3')

In summary, our data provide evidence for a novel action of corticosteroids: suppression of allergic inflammation through a rapid inhibitory effect on GATA-3 nuclear translocation by preferential binding to the shared nuclear import protein importin-alpha and by a second mechanism involving increased synthesis of MKP-1, which inhibits p38 MAPK, thus preventing the phosphorylation of GATA-3 that is necessary for nuclear translocation of GATA-3.
('GATA-3', 'Binding', 'GATA-3'),('GATA-3', 'Localization', 'GATA-3')

We demonstrate that upon stimulation by lipopolysaccharide, Taxol, phorbol myristate acetate, interleukin-1, or double-stranded RNA, I kappaB alpha is not degraded, as a result of an absence of induced phosphorylation on serines 32 and 36.

Wild-Type and LMP1 Transgenic Lymphoma Cells Do Not Require IL4 and Stat6 Signaling
('IL4', 'Phosphorylation', 'Stat6')

Activated Stat6 (pStat6), a target of the IL4 receptor pathway, was detected in the wild-type and LMP1 transgenic lymphocytes (Figure 4B).
('IL4', 'Phosphorylation', 'Stat6')

However, the pathway was not disabled, as treatment of the lymphoma cells with IL4 induced Stat6 phosphorylation (Figure 4C).
('IL4', 'Phosphorylation', 'Stat6')

In summary, the wild-type and LMP1 transgenic lymphoma cells grew independently of IL4 treatment and did not require Stat6 signaling.
('IL4', 'Phosphorylation', 'Stat6')

TCF-1 alpha, originally identified and purified through its binding sites on the HIV-1 promoter, was found to bind to the TCR alpha enhancer and to promoters for several genes expressed at significantly earlier stages of T-cell development than the TCR alpha gene (e.g., p56lck and CD3 delta).
('TCR alpha', 'Transcription', 'TCF-1 alpha')

A small 95-bp fragment of the TCR alpha control region that contains the TCF-1 alpha binding site juxtaposed between a cAMP-response element (the CRE or T alpha 1 motif) and the binding site for a distinct lymphoid-specific protein (TCF-2 alpha) behaved as a potent T-cell-specific enhancer in vivo.
('TCR alpha', 'Transcription', 'TCF-1 alpha'),('TCF-2 alpha', 'Transcription', 'TCF-1 alpha')

The TCF-1 alpha binding site was also required for TCR alpha enhancer activity in transcriptionally active extracts from Jurkat but not HeLa cells, confirming that TCF-1 alpha is a T-cell-specific transcription factor.
('TCR alpha', 'Transcription', 'TCF-1 alpha')

Curiously, the TCF-1 alpha binding element was inactive in vivo when removed from its neighboring elements on the TCR alpha enhancer and positioned in one or more copies upstream of a heterologous promoter.
('TCR alpha', 'Transcription', 'TCF-1 alpha')

Thus, the transcriptional activity of TCF-1 alpha appears to depend on the TCF-2 alpha and T alpha 1 (CREB) transcription factors and the context of its binding site within the TCR alpha enhancer.
('CREB', 'Transcription', 'TCF-1 alpha'),('TCR alpha', 'Transcription', 'TCF-1 alpha'),('TCF-2 alpha', 'Transcription', 'TCF-1 alpha')

We examined the contribution of the two isoforms of STAT5, STAT5A and STAT5B, to IL-2- and IL-7-induced activation of human peripheral blood T lymphoblasts.
('IL-7', 'Binding', 'STAT5B'),('IL-2', 'Binding', 'STAT5B'),('IL-7', 'Binding', 'STAT5A'),('IL-2', 'Phosphorylation', 'STAT5A'),('IL-7', 'Phosphorylation', 'STAT5B'),('IL-2', 'Localization', 'STAT5B'),('IL-2', 'Phosphorylation', 'STAT5B'),('IL-2', 'Binding', 'STAT5A'),('IL-2', 'Localization', 'STAT5A'),('IL-7', 'Phosphorylation', 'STAT5A')

Both cytokines induced assembly of STAT5A and STAT5B containing complexes capable of binding to the interferon-gamma activation sequence (GAS), and these complexes rapidly translocated (within 1 min) into the nucleus of IL-2- or IL-7-treated cells.
('IL-7', 'Binding', 'STAT5B'),('IL-2', 'Binding', 'STAT5B'),('IL-7', 'Binding', 'STAT5A'),('IL-2', 'Phosphorylation', 'STAT5A'),('IL-7', 'Phosphorylation', 'STAT5B'),('IL-2', 'Localization', 'STAT5B'),('IL-2', 'Phosphorylation', 'STAT5B'),('IL-2', 'Binding', 'STAT5A'),('IL-2', 'Localization', 'STAT5A'),('IL-7', 'Phosphorylation', 'STAT5A')

IL-2 and IL-7 were equivalent in their ability to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5A and STAT5B and to facilitate binding of these STATs to an immobilized GAS element.
('IL-7', 'Binding', 'STAT5B'),('IL-2', 'Binding', 'STAT5B'),('IL-7', 'Binding', 'STAT5A'),('IL-2', 'Phosphorylation', 'STAT5A'),('IL-7', 'Phosphorylation', 'STAT5B'),('IL-2', 'Localization', 'STAT5B'),('IL-2', 'Phosphorylation', 'STAT5B'),('IL-2', 'Binding', 'STAT5A'),('IL-2', 'Localization', 'STAT5A'),('IL-7', 'Phosphorylation', 'STAT5A')

Both IL-2 and IL-7 induced substantial amounts of STAT5A/STAT5B heterodimerization.

Characterization of this cDNA clone revealed that its induction was dependent on LPS activation of THP-1 cells; hence, the name LPS-induced TNF-alpha factor (LITAF).
('LITAF', 'Positive_regulation', 'TNF-alpha'),('LITAF', 'Gene_expression', 'TNF-alpha')

Inhibition of LITAF mRNA expression in THP-1 cells resulted in a reduction of TNF-alpha transcripts.
('LITAF', 'Positive_regulation', 'TNF-alpha'),('LITAF', 'Gene_expression', 'TNF-alpha')

Together, these findings suggest that LITAF plays an important role in the activation of the human TNF-alpha gene and proposes a new mechanism to control TNF-alpha gene expression.
('LITAF', 'Positive_regulation', 'TNF-alpha'),('LITAF', 'Gene_expression', 'TNF-alpha')

In a concentration-dependent manner, NO inhibited interleukin (IL)-1 alpha-stimulated VCAM-1 expression by 35-55% as determined by cell surface enzyme immunoassays and flow cytometry.

We therefore asked whether IL-4 is able to inhibit TGF-beta induction of FOXP3 during the priming of naive T cells.
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

Human CD4+CD45RA+ T cells were activated with plate-bound anti-CD3/CD28 in the presence of TGF-beta and/or IL-4 and harvested after 5 d. IL-4 efficiently repressed the TGF-beta-mediated induction of FOXP3 expression (Figure 5A) in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 5B).
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

Low levels of GATA3 were induced also in the absence of IL-4, as it was previously observed [3].
('IL-4', 'Negative_regulation', 'GATA3'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'GATA3')

However, at low concentration, IL-4 was able to marginally induce FOXP3 expression.
('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

Of note, GATA3 was also induced in the presence of TGF-beta at high IL-4 concentration (Figure 5A and 5B).
('IL-4', 'Negative_regulation', 'GATA3'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'GATA3')

The IL-4-mediated prevention of FOXP3 expression was not caused by interferences of the receptor signaling, because the phosphorylation of SMAD2 or STAT6 was not affected by the addition of IL-4 and/or TGF-beta, which demonstrates that IL-4 as well as TGF-beta signaling were functional under these conditions (Figure 5C).
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Phosphorylation', 'STAT6'),('IL-4', 'Phosphorylation', 'SMAD2'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Phosphorylation', 'STAT6'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Phosphorylation', 'SMAD2')

Increasing amounts of IL-4 increase intracellular GATA3, whereas FOXP3 decreased, which is consistent with the mRNA analysis (Figure 5D).
('IL-4', 'Negative_regulation', 'GATA3'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'GATA3'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

To study the effects of IL-4 on already-existing human natural or inducible Treg cells, we exposed sorted CD25+ T cells (nTreg cells) to IL-4 and analyzed FOXP3 expression and suppressive capacity.
('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

In already-existing Treg cells, IL-4 failed to inhibit FOXP3 expression (Figure S3A), and the suppressive capacity was not altered (Figure S3C).
('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

Similarly pre-existing iTreg cells did not decrease FOXP3 expression upon IL-4 exposure (Figure S3B).

LMP1 transgenic mice have a higher incidence of lymphoma [26] and the progression to lymphoma correlates with higher expression levels of LMP1 (Figure 1A and 1B), suggesting that LMP1 is directly involved in tumor development.
('LMP1', 'Gene_expression', 'LMP1')

Although many of the molecular properties studied were similar between wild-type and LMP1 transgenic lymphomas, there were distinguishing biological properties, namely the ability of LMP1 transgenic lymphomas to induce higher levels of survival and proliferation.
('LMP1', 'Gene_expression', 'LMP1')

Interestingly, although LMP1 transgenic mice develop lymphomas in the same B-1a cell type as spontaneous wild-type lymphomas (Figure 2), some signaling effects induced by LMP1 may explain the enhanced promotion to lymphomagenesis.
('LMP1', 'Gene_expression', 'LMP1')

In contrast, the preponderance of tumors of B-1a origin does not reflect effects of LMP1 signaling on B cell differentiation, as splenic B cells from healthy LMP1 transgenic mice contain similar numbers of B-1 and B-2 cells as wild-type mice.
('LMP1', 'Gene_expression', 'LMP1')

The lymphomas were marked by the upregulation of IL10, constitutive activation of Stat3 signaling, and a requirement for activation of Akt, NFkappaB, and Stat3 pathways (Figures 5 and 7).
('IL10', 'Positive_regulation', 'Stat3')

In addition, LMP1 has been shown to stimulate IL10 expression in Burkitt lymphoma cell lines [61,62].
('LMP1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL10')

This suggests that although Stat3 is constitutively activated in the lymphoma cells, the induction of IL10 may further enhance Stat3 activation or may contribute to other IL10-responsive signaling pathways.
('IL10', 'Positive_regulation', 'Stat3')

LMP1 activates both the canonical and non-canonical pathways of NFkappaB signaling [14,63-65], and inhibition of NFkappaB blocked the survival of LMP1 transgenic lymphocytes and LMP1-positive and -negative lymphoma cells.
('LMP1', 'Gene_expression', 'LMP1')

We have previously shown that cRel is specifically activated in both wild-type and LMP1 transgenic lymphomas, suggesting that activation of cRel is associated with B cell transformation [27].
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'cRel')

Our observations suggest that similar to CD40-induced proliferation, LMP1 induces proliferation through PI3K-mediated activation of Akt and activation of NFkappaB components such as cRel.
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'Akt'),('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'cRel')

CD40 also induces downregulation of the cell cycle inhibitor p27 through a PI3K-dependent manner, and the LMP1 lymphoma cells also had decreased levels of p27 with phosphorylation of Rb and increased Cdk2 (Figure 6C) [66].
('CD40', 'Negative_regulation', 'p27')

However, the activated pAkt did not lead to phosphorylation and inactivation of the downstream target GSK3 (Figure 6A).
('pAkt', 'Negative_regulation', 'GSK3'),('pAkt', 'Phosphorylation', 'GSK3')

In contrast, rapamycin, U0126, and SB202190 did not affect the survival of LMP1 transgenic lymphocytes or the wild-type and LMP1 transgenic lymphoma cells (Figure 7A, 7C, and 7E).
('LMP1', 'Gene_expression', 'LMP1')

Repression of the pro-apoptotic transcription factor FoxO1 in a PI3K-dependent manner can inhibit expression of bcl6, a transcription factor necessary for GC formation [49,70].
('FoxO1', 'Gene_expression', 'bcl6')

The constitutive signaling by LMP1 likely blocks GC formation through downregulation of bcl6.
('bcl6', 'Gene_expression', 'LMP1'),('LMP1', 'Gene_expression', 'bcl6')

Interestingly, clinical studies indicate that expression of LMP1 and bcl6 are mutually exclusive in non-HD and classical HD [72,73].
('bcl6', 'Gene_expression', 'LMP1'),('LMP1', 'Gene_expression', 'bcl6')

Although the activation of Akt and the lack of Fox01 in the lymphoma cells suggest that LMP1 affects bcl6 and GC formation through this pathway, regulation of other Forkhead targets involved in cell cycle progression, such as p27 and CyclinD2, likely contribute to malignant transformation.
('Akt', 'Negative_regulation', 'Fox01'),('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'Akt'),('bcl6', 'Gene_expression', 'LMP1'),('LMP1', 'Gene_expression', 'bcl6'),('Fox01', 'Regulation', 'bcl6')

Importantly, Akt, NFkappaB, and Stat3 pathways were critically required for the growth and survival of malignant lymphocytes as well as healthy LMP1 transgenic lymphocytes.
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'Akt')

The latter has evolved a mechanism to counteract A3G activity by expressing the regulatory protein Vif (4).
('Vif', 'Negative_regulation', 'A3G'),('Vif', 'Protein_catabolism', 'A3G')

Vif induces proteasomal degradation of A3G and additionally inhibits A3G activity by further mechanisms (8, 37-43).
('Vif', 'Negative_regulation', 'A3G'),('Vif', 'Protein_catabolism', 'A3G')

To investigate whether the overexpression of HIV-1 proteins also influences A3G promoter activity, we either expressed HIV-1 Vif or the HIV-1 Tat protein, the latter has been shown to activate different viral and cellular promoters (44,45).
('Vif', 'Negative_regulation', 'A3G'),('Vif', 'Protein_catabolism', 'A3G')

Luciferase assays showed that the transcriptional activity of the A3G promoter was not significantly altered in the presence of Vif, Tat or HIV-1NL4-3 (Figure 4A), suggesting that HIV-1 is not modulating A3G expression on the transcriptional level.
('Vif', 'Negative_regulation', 'A3G'),('Vif', 'Protein_catabolism', 'A3G')

Interleukin-10 inhibits expression of both interferon alpha- and interferon gamma- induced genes by suppressing tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1.
('Interleukin-10', 'Phosphorylation', 'STAT1')

Therefore, IL-10 can directly inhibit STAT-dependent early response gene expression induced by both IFNalpha and IFNgamma in monocytes by suppressing the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1.
('IL-10', 'Phosphorylation', 'STAT1')

This may occur through the ability of IL-10 to induce expression of the gene, suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3).
('IL-10', 'Gene_expression', 'SOCS3')

Regulation of the Ets-related transcription factor Elf-1 by binding to the retinoblastoma protein.
('retinoblastoma protein', 'Regulation', 'Elf-1')

In this report, it is demonstrated that Elf-1 contains a sequence motif that is highly related to the Rb binding sites of several viral oncoproteins and binds to the pocket region of Rb both in vitro and in vivo.
('Rb', 'Localization', 'Elf-1')

Elf-1 binds exclusively to the underphosphorylated form of Rb and fails to bind to Rb mutants derived from patients with retinoblastoma.
('Rb', 'Localization', 'Elf-1')

Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated an association between Elf-1 and Rb in resting normal human T cells.
('Rb', 'Localization', 'Elf-1')

After T cell activation, the phosphorylation of Rb results in the release of Elf-1, which is correlated temporally with the activation of Elf-1-mediated transcription.
('Rb', 'Localization', 'Elf-1')

Overexpression of a phosphorylation-defective form of Rb inhibited Elf-1-dependent transcription during T cell activation.
('Rb', 'Localization', 'Elf-1')

We report here that 1,25(OH)2D3-mediated repression in Jurkat cells is cycloheximide resistant, suggesting that it is a direct transcriptional repressive effect on IL-2 expression by the vitamin D3 receptor (VDR).
('VDR', 'Transcription', 'IL-2'),('VDR', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2'),('VDR', 'Negative_regulation', 'IL-2')

We therefore examined vitamin D3-mediated repression of activated IL-2 expression by cotransfecting Jurkat cells with IL-2 promoter/reporter constructs and a VDR overexpression vector and by DNA binding.
('VDR', 'Transcription', 'IL-2'),('VDR', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2'),('IL-2', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2'),('VDR', 'Negative_regulation', 'IL-2')

VDR DNA-binding mutants were unable to either bind to this element in vitro or repress in vivo; the VDR DNA-binding domain alone, however, bound the element but also could not repress IL-2 expression.
('VDR', 'Transcription', 'IL-2'),('VDR', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2'),('VDR', 'Negative_regulation', 'IL-2')

These results indicate that DNA binding by VDR is necessary but not sufficient to mediate IL-2 repression.
('VDR', 'Transcription', 'IL-2'),('VDR', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2'),('VDR', 'Negative_regulation', 'IL-2')

By combining partially purified proteins in vitro, we observed the loss of the bound NFATp/AP-1-DNA complex upon inclusion of VDR or VDR-retinoid X receptor.
('VDR', 'Binding', 'NFATp')

Order of addition and off-rate experiments indicate that the VDR-retinoid X receptor heterodimer blocks NFATp/AP-1 complex formation and then stably associates with the NF-AT-1 element.
('VDR', 'Binding', 'NFATp')

We show here that the HIV-1 protease can process p105 and increases levels of active nuclear NF-kappa B complex.

Silencing of human fetal globin expression is impaired in the absence of the adult beta-globin gene activator protein EKLF.
('EKLF', 'Binding', 'beta-globin'),('EKLF', 'Gene_expression', 'beta-globin'),('EKLF', 'Positive_regulation', 'beta-globin')

Previously we and others showed by targeted gene disruption that the zinc finger gene, erythroid Kruppel-like factor (EKLF), is required for expression of the beta-globin gene in mice, presumably through interaction with a high-affinity binding site in the proximal promoter.
('EKLF', 'Binding', 'beta-globin'),('EKLF', 'Gene_expression', 'beta-globin'),('EKLF', 'Positive_regulation', 'beta-globin')

To examine the role of EKLF in the developmental regulation of the human gamma-globin gene we interbred EKLF heterozygotes (+/-) with mice harboring a human beta-globin yeast artificial chromosome transgene.
('EKLF', 'Binding', 'beta-globin'),('EKLF', 'Gene_expression', 'beta-globin'),('EKLF', 'Positive_regulation', 'beta-globin'),('EKLF', 'Regulation', 'gamma-globin'),('EKLF', 'Negative_regulation', 'gamma-globin')

We find that in the absence of EKLF, while human beta-globin expression is dramatically reduced, gamma-globin transcripts are elevated approximately 5-fold.
('EKLF', 'Binding', 'beta-globin'),('EKLF', 'Gene_expression', 'beta-globin'),('EKLF', 'Positive_regulation', 'beta-globin'),('EKLF', 'Regulation', 'gamma-globin'),('EKLF', 'Negative_regulation', 'gamma-globin')

Impaired silencing of gamma-globin expression identifies EKLF as the first transcription factor participating quantitatively in the gamma-globin to beta-globin switch.

Our findings are compatible with a competitive model of switching in which EKLF mediates an adult stage-specific interaction between the beta-globin gene promoter and the locus control region that excludes the gamma-globin gene.

Functional inactivation of Foxp3 by genetic mutations affecting the Foxp3 coding region, as demonstrated in IPEX, or repression of Foxp3 expression by the HTLV-I-encoded transactivator protein Tax, as recently reported in patients with HAM/TSP, results in loss of regulatory activity in CD4+CD25hi T cells [4,8,17].
('Foxp3', 'Localization', 'Foxp3'),('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'Foxp3'),('Foxp3', 'Negative_regulation', 'Foxp3'),('Tax', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3')

Although it is clear that Foxp3 regulates T cell proliferation and cytokine production, very little is known concerning the molecular mechanisms of Foxp3 function.
('Foxp3', 'Localization', 'Foxp3'),('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'Foxp3'),('Foxp3', 'Negative_regulation', 'Foxp3')

The first evidence to indicate how Foxp3 promotes the development and function of regulatory T cells came from a report by Ziegler and colleagues [16], which suggested that Foxp3 could inhibit transcriptional activation by physically interacting with forkhead binding sites located immediately adjacent to critical cis-acting NF-AT binding sites found in various cytokine promoters (e.g., IL-2 promoter).
('Foxp3', 'Localization', 'Foxp3'),('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'Foxp3'),('Foxp3', 'Negative_regulation', 'Foxp3'),('Foxp3', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-2')

A recent study by Bettelli and colleagues [15] further demonstrated that Foxp3 could inhibit NF-AT as well as NF-kappaB activation, although the mechanism of suppression was shown to involve direct protein-protein interactions between NF-AT or NF-kappaB and Foxp3 rather than binding of Foxp3 to promoter elements adjacent to cis-acting NF-AT or NF-kappaB sites.
('Foxp3', 'Localization', 'Foxp3'),('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'Foxp3'),('Foxp3', 'Negative_regulation', 'Foxp3')

In the present study, we expanded upon these observations by defining additional requirements of Foxp3-mediated repression of NF-kappaB activation, and investigated whether Foxp3 could target additional signaling pathways by examining transcriptional activation of NF-kappaB-dependent and NF-kappaB-independent retroviral pathogens.
('Foxp3', 'Localization', 'Foxp3'),('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'Foxp3'),('Foxp3', 'Negative_regulation', 'Foxp3')

The characterization of the molecular targets of Foxp3 and the mechanism(s) utilized by Foxp3 to support Treg development and function will aid in our understanding of the role Tregs play in the pathogenesis of human autoimmune disease.

Structure and function analysis of the human myeloid cell nuclear differentiation antigen promoter: evidence for the role of Sp1 and not of c-Myb or PU.1 in myelomonocytic lineage-specific expression.
('Sp1', 'Gene_expression', 'myeloid cell nuclear differentiation antigen'),('PU.1', 'Gene_expression', 'myeloid cell nuclear differentiation antigen'),('c-Myb', 'Gene_expression', 'myeloid cell nuclear differentiation antigen')

A region that may also be important with respect to Foxp3 function is the leucine zipper domain, as demonstrated by the number of mutations associated with IPEX that have been mapped in this region of Foxp3.
('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'Foxp3')

Because the pathogenesis of a number of retroviral-induced immunologic disorders such as HIV-1/AIDS and HTLV-I/HAM/TSP have been associated with dysregulation of Foxp3 expression [8,45], we also examined the role of Foxp3 in retroviral gene expression.
('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'Foxp3')

In addition, the FKH domain of Foxp3 was required for this inhibitory effect in HEK 293T cells, but not in Jurkat T cells, similar to Foxp3-mediated suppression of a synthetic NF-kappaB reporter.
('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'Foxp3')

Foxp3 also affected two well-known functions of HTLV-I Tax: transactivation of the NF-kappaB pathway and, most surprisingly, transactivation of the HTLV-I LTR.
('Tax', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3')

Transactivation of the HTLV-I LTR by Tax involves the interaction of ATF/CREB factors with Tax in the nucleus.
('Tax', 'Binding', 'Tax')

Binding of Tax enhances ATF/CREB dimerization and promotes assembly of Tax-ATF/CREB complexes onto specific sequences in the viral promoter known as Tax-responsive elements.
('Tax', 'Binding', 'Tax')

Transactivation of the NF-kappaB pathway by Tax was inhibited by overexpression of full-length Foxp3, but not deltaFKH, as seen with basal activation of the HIV-1 LTR and a synthetic NF-kappaB reporter in HEK 293T cells.
('Tax', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3')

However, Tax-mediated transactivation of the HTLV-I LTR was inhibited by overexpression of both full-length Foxp3 as well as deltaFKH in both HEK 293T cells and CD4+ T cells.
('Tax', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3')

We demonstrated that Foxp3 did not directly affect the functioning of Tax, but rather Foxp3 targeted the transcription factors required for Tax transactivation (i.e., NF-kappaB and a then-unknown cellular factor, which we identified in this study as CREB).
('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'Foxp3'),('Tax', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3'),('Tax', 'Binding', 'Tax')

Importantly, we demonstrated that HTLV-I-infected individuals with the highest levels of Foxp3 protein expression within the CD4+CD25+ T cells population exhibited lower proviral loads than did individuals with the lowest levels of Foxp3 protein expression.
('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'Foxp3')

Therefore, Foxp3 becomes an attractive target for the development of novel therapeutic applications directed at modulating the expression of this important regulatory protein, especially in light of recent observations that the expression of Foxp3 can also be down-regulated by HTLV-I Tax [8].
('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'Foxp3'),('Tax', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3')

As the activation of the HTLV-I LTR depends primarily on ATF/CREB proteins (whether in the presence or the absence of Tax), we investigated whether Foxp3 could interact with this additional cellular signaling pathway.
('Tax', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3')

Our data demonstrate that Foxp3 interferes with the latter of these two processes and that the recruitment of the coactivator protein p300, and resulting transcriptional activation are blocked by Foxp3.
('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'p300'),('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'Foxp3')

This may be the result of the physical interaction we detected between Foxp3 and p300.
('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'p300')

With respect to HTLV-I LTR activity, while full-length Foxp3 inhibited both basal and Tax-dependent transcription by ~50%, deltaFKH appeared less effective in suppressing basal activation (~25% inhibition) compared to Tax-dependent activation (~50% inhibition).
('Tax', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3'),('Tax', 'Binding', 'Tax')

Future studies will be directed at identifying and characterizing cellular proteins that interact with Foxp3 both in the nucleus and cytoplasm, in order to better address how Foxp3 functions to guide the development and function of regulatory T cells in health and disease.
('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'Foxp3')

Similar to IL-4, IL-13 mRNA expression was highest in T-cell populations enriched for cells that had previously been primed in vivo or in vitro, indicating that priming increases the expression of the IL-13 and IL-4 genes in a coordinate manner.
('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-4')

Interleukin-4 (IL-4) plays a major role in this process by promoting the differentiation of IL-4-secreting Th2 cells.
('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-4')

Nuclear factor of activated T cell (NFAT) family members play a critical role in regulating IL-4 transcription and interact with up to five sequences (termed P0 through P4) in the IL-4 promoter.
('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-4')

The molecular mechanisms by which IL-4 induces expression of the IL-4 gene are not known, although the IL-4-activated transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (Stat6) is required for this effect.
('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-4'),('Stat6', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-4')

We report here that Stat6 interacts with three binding sites in the human IL-4 promoter by electrophoretic mobility shift assays.
('Stat6', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-4')

To investigate the role of Stat6 in regulating IL-4 transcription, we used Stat6-deficient Jurkat T cells with different intact IL-4 promoter constructs in cotransfection assays.
('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-4'),('Stat6', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-4')

We show that, whereas a multimerized response element from the germline IgE promoter was highly induced by IL-4 in Stat6-expressing Jurkat cells, the intact human IL-4 promoter was repressed under similar conditions.
('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-4'),('Stat6', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-4')

We conclude that the function of Stat6 is highly dependent on promoter context and that this factor promotes IL-4 gene expression in an indirect manner.
('Stat6', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-4')

Of the GATA-binding proteins, only GATA-4 selectively regulates the human IL-5 gene promoter in IL-5 producing cells which express multiple GATA-binding proteins.
('IL-5', 'Transcription', 'IL-5'),('GATA-4', 'Regulation', 'IL-5')

Using ATL-16T cells which express IL-5 mRNA, we have identified a region, within the human IL-5 gene promoter, that regulates IL-5 gene transcription.
('IL-5', 'Transcription', 'IL-5')

In this report, we describe the cloning of human GATA-4 (hGATA-4) and show that hGATA-4 selectively interacts with the -70 GATA site within the IL-5 proximal promoter region.
('hGATA-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-5'),('GATA-4', 'Regulation', 'IL-5')

Cotransfection experiments revealed that both hGATA-4 and PMA/A23187 stimulation are necessary for the IL-5 promoter activation.
('hGATA-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-5'),('GATA-4', 'Regulation', 'IL-5')

These results demonstrate the selective role of GATA-4 in the transcriptional regulation of the IL-5 gene in a circumstance where multiple members of the GATA-binding proteins are expressed.
('GATA-4', 'Regulation', 'IL-5')

Here we report an analysis of the transcription factor families AP-1, Sp1, NF-kappaB, and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) in cancer patients' lymphocytes before and after IL-2 immunotherapy, as assessed by a gel-shift assay.
('IL-2', 'Binding', 'Sp1')

Over a 3-week course of IL-2 therapy, in most patients the binding patterns of AP-1 , Sp1, and NF-kappaB proteins changed to resemble those seen in PBMC activated by IL-2 in vitro.
('IL-2', 'Binding', 'Sp1')

Although Foxp3 could down-regulate Tax-dependent transactivation of the HTLV-I LTR (Figure 4B) and inhibit Tax expression from an infectious molecular clone (Figure 5), Foxp3 failed to modulate Tax function in the absence of the viral promoter (Figure 4D).
('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

Therefore, we hypothesized that Foxp3 may inhibit Tax transactivation of the HTLV-I LTR via disruption of the CREB signaling pathway.
('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

To test this possibility, HEK 293T cells were transfected with an HTLV-I LTR or synthetic CREB reporter vector along with a control expression vector (EGFP) or expression vectors encoding Foxp3 or DeltaFKH.
('DeltaFKH', 'Positive_regulation', 'CREB')

Like NF-kappaB activation, CREB transcriptional activation was also suppressed by expression of Foxp3, and to a similar extent DeltaFKH, in healthy donor CD4+ T cells (Figure 6B).
('DeltaFKH', 'Positive_regulation', 'CREB')

As observed with NF-kappaB activation, DeltaFKH was a more potent inhibitor of CREB activation in CD4+ T cells than in HEK 293T cells, further indicating that a cell type-specific mechanism of action may govern the function of this Foxp3 mutant.
('DeltaFKH', 'Positive_regulation', 'CREB')

However, Foxp3 failed to markedly affect transcriptional activation of Gal4-BD-c-Jun (c-Jun has also been demonstrated to bind to the HTLV-I LTR) and Gal4-BD-Tax (see Figure 5).
('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

Therefore, our data suggest that Foxp3 may interfere with CREB signaling at an upstream event, such as phosphorylation of CREB or recruitment/function of coactivator proteins CREB-binding protein (CBP)/p300.
('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'p300'),('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'CREB-binding protein')

The binding of interleukin-2 (IL-2) to its receptor on normal T cells induces nuclear expression of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB), activation of the IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) alpha chain gene, and cell proliferation.
('IL-2', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) alpha chain')

Flow cytometry revealed that primary leukemia cells from a patient with CD8+ T-PLL expressed IL-2Ralpha and beta chains, and the cells showed a proliferative response and an increase in IL-2Ralpha expression on culture with exogeneous IL-2.
('IL-2', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2Ralpha')

Electrophoretic mobility-shift assays revealed that recombinant IL-2 increased NF-kappaB binding activity in nuclear extracts of the leukemia cells, and Northern blot analysis showed that IL-2 increased the abundance of mRNAs encoding the NF-kappaB components c-Rel and KBF1 in these cells.

The present study investigated PPARalpha expression in human ECs and their regulation of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1).
('PPARalpha', 'Gene_expression', 'VCAM-1')

Pretreatment of cultured human ECs with the PPARalpha activators fenofibrate or WY14643 inhibited TNF-alpha-induced VCAM-1 in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, an effect not seen with PPARgamma activators.
('PPARalpha', 'Gene_expression', 'VCAM-1')

Both PPARalpha activators decreased cytokine-induced VCAM-1 mRNA expression without altering its mRNA half-life.
('PPARalpha', 'Gene_expression', 'VCAM-1')

In 6 of 14 patients, T lymphocytes displayed an impaired ability to translocate NFeB p65 (Rel-A) following activation by anti-CD3 and IL-2.
('Rel-A', 'Transcription', 'IL-2')

Finally, despite impaired Rel-A translocation, T cells were capable of transcribing IL-2.
('Rel-A', 'Transcription', 'IL-2')

Impairments in the translocation of Rel-B and c-Rel further suggest that the NFKB family members Rel-A, Rel-B and c-Rel are not required for the transcription of IL-2 in the peripheral T lymphocytes of patients with breast cancer.
('c-Rel', 'Transcription', 'IL-2'),('Rel-A', 'Transcription', 'IL-2'),('Rel-B', 'Transcription', 'IL-2')

HTLV-I Tax expression leads to the constitutive nuclear expression of biologically active NF-kappa B and c-Rel complexes; however, the biochemical mechanism(s) underlying this response remains poorly understood.
('Tax', 'Gene_expression', 'c-Rel')

We further demonstrate that Tax induction of nuclear c-Rel expression is activated by the RelA (p65) subunit of NF-kappa B, which activates transcription of the c-rel gene through an intrinsic kappa B enhancer element.

Again, IL-10-producing Th1 cells were differentiated at the high antigen dose in the presence of IL-12 in DO11.10 Tcells (Figure2A).
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

In contrast, in the absence of STAT4, the percentage of cells expressing IFN-gamma was dramatically diminished as expected and resulted in an increase in the percentage of cells expressing IL-4, but not IL-10 (Figure2A), suggesting that STAT4 contributes to IL-10 expression by Th1 cells.
('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('STAT4', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('IFN-gamma', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('STAT4', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-4'),('STAT4', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IFN-gamma', 'Localization', 'IL-4')

Because IL-10 expression is associated with an IL-4-induced Th2 cell phenotype, we investigated whether the differentiation of the IL-10-producing Th1 cells depended on signaling through the IL-4 receptor via STAT6 activation (Glimcher and Murphy, 2000; Murphy etal., 2000).
('STAT6', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('STAT6', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-4')

The absence of STAT6 did not impair the differentiation of IL-10-producing Th1 cells in the presence of IL-12 and OVA (Figure2A).
('STAT6', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('OVA', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

In fact, a higher percentage of STAT6-deficient cells compared with WT cells produced both IL-10 and IFN-gamma (Figure2A), which may be the result of the loss of Th2 cell control over a Th1 cell response.
('STAT6', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IFN-gamma', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

As expected, lack of STAT6 abrogated both IL-4 and IL-10 production by Tcells developed with IL-4 or with low antigen dose (Figures 2B and 2C).
('STAT6', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('STAT6', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-4')

However, in the absence of STAT4 signaling, IL-10 and IL-4 production by Th2 cells was if anything increased (Figures 2B and 2C).
('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('STAT4', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-4'),('STAT4', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Thus, in contrast to what was observed under Th1 conditions, IL-10 expression by Th2 cells depended on STAT6, but not on STAT4, signaling (Figures 2B and 2C).
('STAT6', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('STAT4', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

To investigate whether the inability of STAT4-deficient Tcells to produce IL-10 might be due to the absence of IFN-gamma, as suggested before (Shaw etal., 2006), we differentiated DO11.10 or DO11.10 IFN-gamma-deficient naive CD4+ Tcells in the presence of IL-12 and increasing doses of OVA.
('OVA', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IFN-gamma', 'Regulation', 'IL-12'),('STAT4', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('IFN-gamma', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('STAT4', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

The secretion of IL-10 as induced by high antigen dose, and IL-12 was not affected by an absence of IFN-gamma (Figure2D), showing that the expression ofIL-10 by Th1 cells is independent of IFN-gamma.
('IFN-gamma', 'Regulation', 'IL-12'),('IFN-gamma', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

In the absence of IFN-gamma, we observed an increase in the secreted IL-4 as expected (data not shown).
('IFN-gamma', 'Localization', 'IL-4')

We also tested for any potential role of IL-4 in the development of Th1 cells producing IL-10 by culturing DO11.10 or DO11.10 IL-4-deficient naive CD4+ Tcells with IL-12 and increasing doses of antigen.
('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

As observed in the absence of STAT6 (Figure2A), IL-4 deficiency had no effect on the development of Th1 cells producing IL-10 (Figure2E), but compromised the development of Th2 cells producing IL-10 (Figure2F).
('STAT6', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('STAT6', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-4')

Thus, our data suggested that IL-10 production by Th1 or Th2 cells was dependent on the specific signaling pathways required for their differentiation, given that STAT4 is required for the induction of IL-10 production by Th1 cells and STAT6 for Th2 cells.
('STAT6', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('STAT4', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

The NF-kappaB family includes RelA/p65, c-Rel, RelB, p50 and p52 that share a highly conserved 300-amino acid Rel homology domain (RHD) for homo- or hetero-dimerization and DNA-binding.
('p52', 'Binding', 'c-Rel'),('p52', 'Binding', 'p50'),('RelA', 'Binding', 'p52'),('RelB', 'Binding', 'p52'),('RelA', 'Binding', 'RelB'),('RelB', 'Binding', 'c-Rel'),('p52', 'Binding', 'RelB'),('RelB', 'Binding', 'p50'),('c-Rel', 'Binding', 'RelA'),('c-Rel', 'Binding', 'p52'),('p52', 'Binding', 'RelA'),('c-Rel', 'Binding', 'RelB'),('c-Rel', 'Binding', 'p50'),('p50', 'Binding', 'RelA'),('p50', 'Binding', 'p52'),('p50', 'Binding', 'RelB'),('RelA', 'Binding', 'c-Rel'),('RelB', 'Binding', 'RelA'),('p50', 'Binding', 'c-Rel'),('RelA', 'Binding', 'p50')

The transcriptional activity of the NF-kappaB complex depends on dimer composition since C-terminal unrelated transcriptional activation domains are present exclusively in p65, RelB and c-Rel (2).
('RelB', 'Binding', 'c-Rel'),('c-Rel', 'Binding', 'RelB')

The NF-kappaB activity is enhanced by phosphorylation of p65 at Ser276 by PKA and MSK1 (7,8), Ser311 by PKCzeta (9) and Ser536 by IKKalpha (10,11).
('PKCzeta', 'Phosphorylation', 'p65'),('MSK1', 'Phosphorylation', 'p65'),('IKKalpha', 'Phosphorylation', 'p65')

Acetylation of p65 at Lys218 and Lys221 increases the DNA binding and impairs the association with IkappaB-alpha, and acetylation at Lys310 enhances the p65 transcriptional activity (12,13).
('p65', 'Binding', 'p65')

Deacetylation of p65 by histone deacetylase-3 or SIRT1, or acetylation of p65 at Lys122 and Lys123 down-regulate the NF-kappaB activity (12,21,22).
('p65', 'Binding', 'p65')

In HIV-1 entry, the binding of the gp120 viral envelope to CD4 induces the NF-kappaB activity by activation of IKK (30) and procaspase 8 (31).
('gp120', 'Positive_regulation', 'procaspase 8')

Tat binds to RNA stem-loop structures generated by the 5' end of target transcripts, including the HIV-1 transactivation-responsive element (TAR) (32), tumor necrosis factor beta (TNFbeta) (33) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) (34) to activate gene transcription.
('Tat', 'Transcription', 'interleukin-6'),('Tat', 'Transcription', 'tumor necrosis factor beta')

Following gene transfection or protein transduction, Tat induced the IKK activity and proteasomal degradation of IkappaB-alpha (48), and increased the p65 transcriptional activity by inhibiting the SIRT-1-mediated deacetylation of p65 Lys310 (49).
('p65', 'Binding', 'p65'),('SIRT-1', 'Deacetylation', 'p65'),('Tat', 'Protein_catabolism', 'IkappaB-alpha')

These findings suggested that Tat modulates crucial enzymes involved in NF-kappaB signaling; however, it was unclear how Tat could subvert the negative feedback of NF-kappaB, which is mainly dependent on de novo synthesis of IkappaB-alpha (15,17).
('Tat', 'Protein_catabolism', 'IkappaB-alpha')

We previously found that IkappaB-alpha binds to Tat and promotes the nuclear export of the viral transactivator (50,51).
('Tat', 'Protein_catabolism', 'IkappaB-alpha')

In this study, we report that Tat counteracts the post-activation turn off of NF-kappaB through direct interaction with IkappaB-alpha and p65, which enhances the DNA binding and transcriptional activity of the NF-kappaB complex.
('Tat', 'Protein_catabolism', 'IkappaB-alpha')

The human TF promoter contains binding sites for the transcription factors AP-1, c-Rel/p65, Egr-1, and Sp1.
('Sp1', 'Gene_expression', 'TF'),('p65', 'Gene_expression', 'TF'),('c-Rel', 'Gene_expression', 'TF'),('Egr-1', 'Gene_expression', 'TF')

These data indicated that c-Fos/c-Jun, c-Rel/p65, and Sp1 regulate TF gene expression in human monocytic cells.
('Sp1', 'Gene_expression', 'TF'),('p65', 'Gene_expression', 'TF'),('c-Fos', 'Gene_expression', 'TF'),('c-Rel', 'Gene_expression', 'TF'),('c-Jun', 'Gene_expression', 'TF')

Since both AP-1 and NF-kappa B have been reported to be important in the induction of the tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) gene we examined the effects of okadaic acid on TNF-alpha mRNA levels.
('TNF-alpha', 'Localization', 'TNF-alpha')

Treatment with okadaic acid resulted in a striking increase in TNF-alpha mRNA transcripts within 1 h of stimulation and large amounts of TNF-alpha were released into the culture media.
('TNF-alpha', 'Localization', 'TNF-alpha')

Moreover, cotransfections with c-fos and c-jun expression plasmids markedly enhance induction of the IL-2 promoter in minimally stimulated T cells.

MEK1 and the extracellular signal-regulated kinases are required for the stimulation of IL-2 gene transcription in T cells.
('MEK1', 'Transcription', 'IL-2')

Active Raf-1 phosphorylates and activates the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase 1 (MEK1), which in turn phosphorylates and activates the MAP kinases/extracellular signal regulated kinases, ERK1 and ERK2.
('Raf-1', 'Phosphorylation', 'MEK1'),('MEK1', 'Phosphorylation', 'ERK1'),('MEK1', 'Phosphorylation', 'ERK2')

Raf-1 activity promotes IL-2 production in activated T lymphocytes.
('Raf-1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2')

Therefore, we sought to determine whether MEK1 and ERK activities also stimulate IL-2 gene transcription.
('MEK1', 'Transcription', 'IL-2')

Expression of constitutively active Raf-1 or MEK1 in Jurkat T cells enhanced the stimulation of IL-2 promoter-driven transcription stimulated by a calcium ionophore and PMA, and together with a calcium ionophore the expression of each protein was sufficient to stimulate NF-AT activity.
('MEK1', 'Transcription', 'IL-2'),('Raf-1', 'Phosphorylation', 'MEK1'),('Raf-1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2')

Expression of MEK1-interfering mutants inhibited the stimulation of IL-2 promoter-driven transcription and blocked the ability of constitutively active Ras and Raf-1 to costimulate NF-AT activity with a calcium ionophore.
('MEK1', 'Transcription', 'IL-2'),('Raf-1', 'Phosphorylation', 'MEK1'),('Raf-1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2')

Expression of the MAP kinase-specific phosphatase, MKP-1, which blocks ERK activation, inhibited IL-2 promoter and NF-AT-driven transcription stimulated by a calcium ionophore and PMA, and in addition, MKP-1 neutralized the transcriptional enhancement caused by active Raf-1 and MEK1 expression.
('MEK1', 'Transcription', 'IL-2'),('Raf-1', 'Phosphorylation', 'MEK1'),('Raf-1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2')

We conclude that the MAP kinase signal transduction pathway consisting of Raf-1, MEK1, and ERK1 and ERK2 functions in the stimulation IL-2 gene transcription in activated T lymphocytes.

GATA-3 plays a critical role in regulating the expression of the cytokines interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, and IL-13 from T helper-2 (Th2) cells and therefore is a key mediator of allergic diseases.

Overexpression of hematopoietic protein-tyrosine phosphatase (HePTP) results in suppression of T lymphocyte activation as measured by T cell antigen receptor-induced activation of transcription factors binding to the 5' promoter of the interleukin-2 gene.
('HePTP', 'Positive_regulation', '2')

Efforts to pinpoint the exact site of action and specificity of HePTP in the signaling cascade revealed that HePTP acts directly on the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases Erk1 and 2 and consequently reduces the magnitude and duration of their catalytic activation in intact T cells.

IL-10 Production by Th1 Cells Is Dependent on STAT4 but Not on STAT6, IFN-gamma, or IL-4 Signaling
('STAT6', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('STAT4', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('STAT6', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-4'),('IFN-gamma', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('STAT4', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-4'),('STAT4', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IFN-gamma', 'Localization', 'IL-4')

The absence of STAT6 did not impair the differentiation of IL-10-producing Th1 cells in the presence of IL-12 and OVA (Figure 2A).
('STAT6', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('OVA', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

In fact, a higher percentage of STAT6-deficient cells compared with WT cells produced both IL-10 and IFN-gamma (Figure 2A), which may be the result of the loss of Th2 cell control over a Th1 cell response.

Differential effects of protein kinase C inhibitors on fibronectin-induced interleukin-beta gene transcription, protein synthesis and secretion in human monocytic cells.
('fibronectin', 'Localization', 'interleukin-beta'),('fibronectin', 'Transcription', 'interleukin-beta')

Human monocytic cells express interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) when stimulated with the extracellular matrix glycoprotein, fibronectin (FN).
('FN', 'Transcription', 'IL-1beta'),('FN', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-1beta')

Protein kinase C (PKC) activation is considered important for this process; however, the metabolic steps at which PKC acts upon to mediate the FN-induced IL-1beta response remain unclear.
('FN', 'Transcription', 'IL-1beta'),('FN', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-1beta')

We performed an analysis of the mechanisms by which two PKC inhibitors, Calphostin C and Staurosporine, prevent the FN-induced IL-1beta response.
('FN', 'Transcription', 'IL-1beta'),('FN', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-1beta')

Both inhibitors blocked the secretion of IL-1beta protein into the media of peripheral blood mononuclear cells exposed to FN.
('FN', 'Transcription', 'IL-1beta'),('FN', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-1beta')

These studies revealed that Calphostin C inhibited the nuclear translocation of the transcription factor activator protein-1 (AP-1) which is considered necessary for FN induction of IL-1beta gene transcription, and prevented the transcription of the IL-1beta gene.
('FN', 'Transcription', 'IL-1beta'),('FN', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-1beta')

Based on the high specificity of this compound for PKC, we conclude that PKC is necessary for FN-induced IL-1beta protein production.

Tat activates the p65-dependent expression of NF-kappaB-responsive genes, occupies the NF-kappaB enhancers and promotes the p65 recruitment with IkappaB-alpha displacement
('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65'),('p65', 'Binding', 'Tat'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'IkappaB-alpha')

To this end, HeLa cells were transfected with FLAG-Tat, FLAG-Tat C(22,25,27)A or FLAG-Tat R(49-57)A, and 48 h later the expression of a number of NF-kappaB-dependent genes was analysed by real-time PCR.
('Tat', 'Binding', 'Tat')

Tat significantly increased the expression of MIP-1alpha, CSF3, LTA, NFKBIA and TLR2, while the mutants Tat C(22,25,27)A and Tat R(49-57)A were ineffective (Figure 5A-E).
('Tat R(49-57)A', 'Gene_expression', 'NFKBIA'),('Tat', 'Gene_expression', 'LTA'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'Tat'),('Tat', 'Gene_expression', 'CSF3'),('Tat', 'Gene_expression', 'NFKBIA'),('Tat', 'Gene_expression', 'TLR2'),('Tat C(22,25,27)A', 'Gene_expression', 'NFKBIA'),('Tat R(49-57)A', 'Gene_expression', 'CSF3'),('Tat C(22,25,27)A', 'Gene_expression', 'LTA'),('Tat R(49-57)A', 'Gene_expression', 'MIP-1alpha'),('Tat C(22,25,27)A', 'Gene_expression', 'MIP-1alpha'),('Tat C(22,25,27)A', 'Gene_expression', 'TLR2'),('Tat R(49-57)A', 'Gene_expression', 'TLR2'),('Tat R(49-57)A', 'Gene_expression', 'LTA'),('Tat', 'Gene_expression', 'MIP-1alpha'),('Tat C(22,25,27)A', 'Gene_expression', 'CSF3')

The Tat-dependent transactivation of the NF-kappaB-dependent genes was abolished when cells were transfected with siRNA p65, indicating that the Tat transcriptional activation was mediated by p65 (Figure 5A-E).
('Tat', 'Binding', 'Tat'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65'),('p65', 'Binding', 'Tat')

These results were consistent with the requirement of both the cysteine-rich and arginine-rich domains of Tat to enhance the NF-kappaB activity, suggesting that the up-regulation of NF-kappaB-responsive genes by Tat might occur through physical interaction of the viral protein with p65 and IkappaB-alpha.
('Tat', 'Binding', 'Tat'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65'),('p65', 'Binding', 'Tat'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'IkappaB-alpha')

MIP-1alpha, which was the mostly activated gene by Tat, encodes for a chemokine that promotes the recruitment of pro-inflammatory cells (56).
('Tat', 'Gene_expression', 'MIP-1alpha')

Consistently with our findings, MIP-1alpha expression was increased in glial cells and lymph nodes of AIDS patients (57,58); moreover, MIP-1alpha production was induced by HIV-1 infection (59,60) and Tat protein (57,61,62).
('Tat', 'Gene_expression', 'MIP-1alpha')

To validate the predicted NF-kappaB binding sites of the MIP-1alpha promoter, we stimulated HeLa cells with TNF-alpha, a well-known NF-kappaB inducer, and measured the expression levels of MIP-1alpha by real-time PCR, and the p65 occupancy of the NF-kappaB sites by ChIP.
('TNF-alpha', 'Gene_expression', 'MIP-1alpha'),('TNF-alpha', 'Binding', 'p65')

TNF-alpha activated the expression of MIP-1alpha and induced the p65 recruitment to the NF-kappaB1 site of MIP-1alpha without affecting the occupancy of the putative NF-kappaB2 and NF-kappaB3 sites (Supplementary Figure S3B and S3C).
('TNF-alpha', 'Gene_expression', 'MIP-1alpha'),('TNF-alpha', 'Binding', 'p65')

Tat also promoted the recruitment of p65 to the NF-kappaB1 site of MIP-1alpha, while it did not affect the putative NF-kappaB2 and NF-kappaB3 sites (Supplementary Figure S3D).
('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65'),('p65', 'Binding', 'Tat'),('Tat', 'Gene_expression', 'MIP-1alpha')

Altogether these results indicated that the NF-kappaB1 site was the only effective NF-kappaB enhancer of the MIP-1alpha promoter in response to TNF-alpha and Tat.
('TNF-alpha', 'Gene_expression', 'MIP-1alpha'),('Tat', 'Gene_expression', 'MIP-1alpha')

Similarly to MIP-1alpha, Tat increased the recruitment of p65 to the NF-kappaB enhancers of CSF3, LTA, NFKBIA and TLR2, while it was ineffective at the promoters of GAPDH and ACTB (Figure 5H).
('Tat', 'Gene_expression', 'LTA'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65'),('Tat', 'Gene_expression', 'CSF3'),('Tat', 'Gene_expression', 'NFKBIA'),('Tat', 'Gene_expression', 'TLR2'),('p65', 'Binding', 'Tat'),('Tat', 'Gene_expression', 'MIP-1alpha')

By ChIP, Tat bound to the NF-kappaB-responsive promoters, and not to the GAPDH and ACTB promoters, with loss of binding following p65 RNA interference (Figure 5I), suggesting that Tat occupancy occurred via p65 interaction.
('Tat', 'Binding', 'Tat'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65'),('p65', 'Binding', 'Tat')

As additional findings, IkappaB-alpha was chromatin-immunoprecipitated at the NF-kappaB enhancers in absence of Tat, and it was significantly removed in presence of Tat, or following IkappaB-alpha RNA interference (Figure 5J), indicating that Tat displaced IkappaB-alpha from promoters.

Further, Vpr suppresses expression of IL-2, IL-10, IL-12, TNF alpha and IL-4, all of which are NF-kappa B-dependent.

Further analysis of general coactivator requirements showed that selective removal of PC4 from the essential USA fraction severely impairs Oct-1 and OCA-B function in a cell-free system reconstituted with partially purified factors.
('PC4', 'Negative_regulation', 'Oct-1'),('PC4', 'Positive_regulation', 'Oct-1'),('PC4', 'Negative_regulation', 'OCA-B')

Full activity can be restored by the combined action of recombinant PC4 and the PC4-depleted USA fraction, thus suggesting a joint requirement for PC4 and another, USA-derived component(s) for optimal function of Oct-1/OCA-B in the reconstituted system.
('PC4', 'Negative_regulation', 'Oct-1'),('PC4', 'Positive_regulation', 'Oct-1'),('PC4', 'Negative_regulation', 'OCA-B')

Consistent with the requirement for PC4 in the reconstituted system, OCA-B was found to interact directly with PC4.
('PC4', 'Negative_regulation', 'OCA-B')

Surprisingly, however, removal of PC4 from the unfractionated nuclear extract has no detrimental effect on OCA-B/Oct-1-dependent transcription.

('GATA3', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

Besides GATA3's well-known positive effect on gene regulation, GATA3's repressive capabilities were previously shown to restrict Th1 commitment by inhibiting STAT4 expression [2,21], and therefore GATA3 prevents differentiation into Th1 cells.

To investigate whether GATA3 can directly inhibit FOXP3 induction, we transduced GATA3 or a truncated GATA3 lacking the DNA-binding domain in human primary CD4+CD45RA+ T cells using a TAT-fused, recombinantly expressed GATA3.
('GATA3', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

TAT-GATA3 reduced FOXP3 expression in a dose-dependent manner, whereas a DNA-binding domain truncated version (TAT-deltaDBD-GATA3) did not affect FOXP3 expression as compared with expression in untransduced cells (Figure 7A).
('GATA3', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('TAT-GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

In addition, we analyzed the inhibitory effect of GATA3 on FOXP3 in transgenic DO11.10 mice, constitutively overexpressing GATA3 under the control of the CD2 locus control region (DO11.10xCD2-GATA3).
('GATA3', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

To investigate the effect of GATA3 on iTreg, CD4+CD62L+CD25- cells were isolated, activated with OVA in the presence or absence of TGF-beta, and Foxp3 expression was analyzed after 4 d. The naive CD4+CD25- cells were Foxp3- (unpublished data).
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3'),('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3')

As described for the human cells, TGF-beta dramatically up-regulated Foxp3 in the DO11.10 littermate control mice.
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3')

In contrast, cells from the CD2-GATA3xDO11.10 mice showed dramatically reduced Foxp3 expression when activated with TGF-beta and OVA (Figure 7B).
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3'),('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3')

One of the isolated genes, that for retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (RALDH2), was regularly expressed in most of the T-ALL cell lines that coexpressed TAL1 and LMO.
('TAL1', 'Transcription', 'RALDH2')

Exogenously transfected TAL1 and LMO, but not either alone, induced RALDH2 expression in a T-ALL cell line, HPB-ALL, not expressing endogeneous TAL1 or LMO.
('TAL1', 'Transcription', 'RALDH2')

In addition, forced expression of GATA3 potentiated the induction of RALDH2 by TAL1 and LMO, and these three factors formed a complex in vivo.
('TAL1', 'Transcription', 'RALDH2')

Furthermore, a TAL1 mutant not binding to DNA also activated the transcription of RALDH2 in the presence of LMO and GATA3.
('TAL1', 'Transcription', 'RALDH2')

Collectively, we have identified the RALDH2 gene as a first example of direct transcriptional target genes regulated by TAL1 and LMO in T-ALL.
('TAL1', 'Transcription', 'RALDH2')

In this case, TAL1 and LMO act as cofactors for GATA3 to activate the transcription of RALDH2.
('TAL1', 'Transcription', 'RALDH2')

Involvement of NF-kappaB p50/p65 heterodimer in activation of the human pro-interleukin-1beta gene at two subregions of the upstream enhancer element.

We show that effector CTL differentiation occurs in two sequential phases in vitro, characterized by early induction of T-bet and late induction of Eomesodermin (Eomes), T-box transcription factors that regulate the early and late phases of interferon (IFN) gamma expression, respectively.
('Eomesodermin', 'Gene_expression', 'interferon (IFN) gamma'),('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'interferon (IFN) gamma')

Runx3 regulates Eomes expression as well as expression of three cardinal markers of the effector CTL program: IFN-gamma, perforin, and granzyme B.

Phosphorylation of TRAF2 inhibits binding to the CD40 cytoplasmic domain.
('TRAF2', 'Binding', 'CD40')

TRAF2 is a signal transducing adaptor molecule which binds to the CD40 cytoplasmic domain.
('TRAF2', 'Binding', 'CD40')

Furthermore, the phosphorylation status of TRAF2 had significant effects on the ability of the protein to bind to CD40, as evidenced by our observations that the CD40 cytoplasmic domain interacted preferentially with underphosphorylated TRAF2 and that phosphatase treatment significantly enhanced the binding of TRAF2 to CD40.
('TRAF2', 'Binding', 'CD40'),('TRAF2', 'Binding', 'TRAF2')

We conclude from these studies that the phosphorylation of TRAF2 is likely to play an important role in regulating signaling by virtue of its ability to influence the CD40-TRAF2 interaction.
('TRAF2', 'Binding', 'CD40'),('TRAF2', 'Binding', 'TRAF2')

Transcriptional activation of the human TF gene in monocytic cells exposed to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is mediated by binding of c-Rel/p65 heterodimers to a kappa B site in the TF promoter.
('c-Rel', 'Positive_regulation', 'TF'),('p65', 'Positive_regulation', 'TF')

These results indicated that salicylates inhibited LPS induction of TF gene transcription in monocytic cells by preventing nuclear translocation of c-Rel/p65 heterodimers.
('c-Rel', 'Positive_regulation', 'TF'),('p65', 'Positive_regulation', 'TF')

Functional association of Nmi with Stat5 and Stat1 in IL-2- and IFNgamma-mediated signaling.
('Nmi', 'Binding', 'Stat1')

Interestingly, Nmi lacks an intrinsic transcriptional activation domain; instead, Nmi enhances the association of CBP/p300 coactivator proteins with Stat1 and Stat5, and together with CBP/p300 can augment IL-2- and IFNgamma-dependent transcription.
('Nmi', 'Binding', 'Stat1')

Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) is activated by a diverse set of receptors that determine T-cell function, including the T-cell antigen receptor (TCR), the costimulatory receptor CD28, and negative regulators of T-cell activation such as CTLA-4.
('CTLA-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'PI 3-kinase')

NleH1 inhibits RPS3 phosphorylation in vitro
('NleH1', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('NleH1', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

The E. coli O157:H7 EDL933 effector protein NleH1 binds to and attenuates RPS3 nuclear translocation, thus impairing RPS3-dependent NF-kappaB signaling9.
('NleH1', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('NleH1', 'Localization', 'RPS3'),('RPS3', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

We therefore hypothesized that NleH1 may function by inhibiting RPS3 S209 phosphorylation.
('NleH1', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('NleH1', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

As expected, transfecting increasing amounts of NleH1-HA plasmid blocked TNFalpha-induced NF-kappaB activation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.
('TNF', 'Gene_expression', 'NleH1')

Remarkably, NleH1 reduced both TNF-induced, as well as basal RPS3 phosphorylation to roughly 20% of vehicle control (Fig.
('TNF', 'Gene_expression', 'NleH1'),('TNF', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('TNF', 'Localization', 'RPS3'),('NleH1', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('NleH1', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

Expressing NleH1 does not interfere with either TNF-induced IKK activation or IkappaBalpha degradation, consistent with the lack of NleH1 impact on p65 nuclear translocation9 (Fig.
('TNF', 'Gene_expression', 'NleH1'),('NleH1', 'Localization', 'p65'),('NleH1', 'Protein_catabolism', 'IkappaBalpha')

To determine if NleH1 inhibits RPS3 phosphorylation, we infected HeLa cells with E. coli O157:H7 strains possessing or lacking either nleH1 (deltanleH1) or with a strain lacking a functional T3SS unable to inject NleH1 into mammalian cells (deltaescN).
('NleH1', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('NleH1', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

In uninfected cells, TNF-treatment stimulated a ~7-fold increase in RPS3 S209 phosphorylation, peaking at 30 minutes (Fig.
('TNF', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('TNF', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

However, TNF-induced RPS3 S209 phosphorylation was unimpaired in cells infected with either deltanleH1 or deltaescN (Fig.
('TNF', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('TNF', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

We showed previously that wild-type, but not deltanleH1 or deltaescN E. coli O157:H7 significantly attenuated TNF-induced RPS3 nuclear translocation9.
('TNF', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('TNF', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

The parallel between RPS3 phosphorylation and its nuclear translocation during E. coli infection provides evidence in the context of an NF-kappaB-dependent disease process that RPS3 S209 phosphorylation is important for nuclear translocation.
('RPS3', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

Our discovery that NleH1 inhibits RPS3 S209 phosphorylation suggested that it should also blocks RPS3-dependent NF-kappaB target gene transcription (e.g.
('NleH1', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('NleH1', 'Localization', 'RPS3'),('RPS3', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

In contrast, deleting nleH1 had no impact on the expression of RPS3-independent genes, including CD25 and TNFSF13B (Supplementary Fig.
('TNF', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('TNF', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

Together these results demonstrate that NleH1 specifically inhibits the protective immune response by directly blocking RPS3 S209 phosphorylation and thereby impairing critical RPS3-dependent NF-kappaB target genes.

Thrombin-induced p65 homodimer binding to downstream NF-kappa B site of the promoter mediates endothelial ICAM-1 expression and neutrophil adhesion.
('Thrombin', 'Binding', 'p65')

We investigated the mechanisms by which proinflammatory mediator, thrombin, released during intravascular coagulation and tissue injury, induces ICAM-1 (CD54) expression in endothelial cells.
('thrombin', 'Gene_expression', 'ICAM-1')

Stimulation of HUVEC with thrombin resulted in dose- and time-dependent increases in ICAM-1 mRNA and cell surface expression and in ICAM-1-dependent endothelial adhesivity toward polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
('thrombin', 'Gene_expression', 'ICAM-1')

Transient transfection of endothelial cells with ICAM-1 promoter luciferase reporter gene (ICAM-1LUC) constructs indicated that deletion of upstream NF-kappa B site (-533 bases from translation start site) had no effect on thrombin responsiveness, whereas mutation/deletion of downstream NF-kappa B site (-223 bases from the translation start site) prevented the activation of ICAM-1 promoter, indicating that the downstream NF-kappa B site is critical for thrombin inducibility.
('thrombin', 'Gene_expression', 'ICAM-1')

Gel supershift assays demonstrated that thrombin induced binding of NF-kappa Bp65 (Rel A) to downstream NF-kappa B site of the ICAM-1 promoter.
('thrombin', 'Binding', 'Rel A'),('thrombin', 'Gene_expression', 'ICAM-1')

Thrombin receptor activation peptide, a 14-amino-acid peptide representing the new NH2 terminus of proteolytically activated receptor-1, mimicked thrombin's action in inducing ICAM-1 expression.
('thrombin', 'Gene_expression', 'ICAM-1')

These data indicate that thrombin activates endothelial ICAM-1 expression and polymorphonuclear leukocyte adhesion by NF-kappa Bp65 binding to the downstream NF-kappa B site of ICAM-1 promoter after proteolytically activated receptor-1 activation.
('proteolytically activated receptor-1', 'Binding', 'p65'),('thrombin', 'Gene_expression', 'ICAM-1')

Examination of IkappaB alpha regulation revealed that TNF-alpha-mediated degradation of IkappaB alpha in both memory and naive T cells from the elderly was severely impaired, thus contributing to the lowered induction of the observed NFkappaB.
('TNF-alpha', 'Protein_catabolism', 'IkappaB alpha')

However, in contrast with TNF-alpha, dopamine treatment did not affect NF-kappaB DNA binding activity nor the concentrations of p50, p65 and IkappaB-alpha proteins, which suggests a distinct NF-kappaB activation mechanism.
('TNF-alpha', 'Regulation', 'IkappaB-alpha'),('TNF-alpha', 'Regulation', 'p65'),('TNF-alpha', 'Regulation', 'p50')

The v-src-induced complex comprised the p50 and p65 components of NF-kappa B, as determined by supershift and immunoblot analysis.
('v-src', 'Binding', 'p50')

Interestingly, the DEX-mediated IkappaBalpha induction was completely inhibited by IL-2, but not IL-4, in Th1 cells, while the reverse profile was seen in Th2 cells.

BMP-6 induces upregulation of Id1
('BMP-6', 'Positive_regulation', 'Id1')

Next, we wanted to explore whether the BMP-6 induced phosphorylation of Smad 1/5/8 also could induce transcriptional changes of target genes.
('BMP-6', 'Phosphorylation', 'Smad 1'),('BMP-6', 'Phosphorylation', '8'),('BMP-6', 'Phosphorylation', '5')

Thus, B cells were pre-incubated over night in X-VIVO 15, and then cultured in medium alone or in the presence of BMP-6 for various time points before preparation of total RNA.
('BMP-6', 'Phosphorylation', '5')

Interestingly, we observed a specific four-fold upregulation of Id1 mRNA in BMP-6-treated B cells (Figure 7).
('BMP-6', 'Positive_regulation', 'Id1')

The up-regulation of Id1 mRNA was characteristic of an early inducible gene, with maximal upregulation two hours after the addition of BMP-6 and returned to baseline after 24 hours.
('BMP-6', 'Positive_regulation', 'Id1')

Western blot analysis revealed that the BMP-6-induced upregulation of Id1 mRNA also was correlated with upregulation of Id1 protein as well.
('Id1', 'Positive_regulation', 'Id1'),('BMP-6', 'Positive_regulation', 'Id1')

The increase in Id1 protein level was detectable after one hour and increased until 24 hours after BMP-6 addition, showing a 16-fold upregulation compared with t0 (p </= 0.020, n = 4) (Figure 8 and 9).
('BMP-6', 'Phosphorylation', '8'),('BMP-6', 'Positive_regulation', 'Id1')

Taken together, these data suggest that Id1 could be a possible target gene for mediating the effects of BMP-6 in human B cells, whereas Id2 and Id3 not seem to be involved.
('BMP-6', 'Positive_regulation', 'Id1'),('BMP-6', 'Gene_expression', 'Id3'),('BMP-6', 'Gene_expression', 'Id2')

After its associated proteins, especially the heat-shock protein hsp90, had been cross-linked with the hMR by dimethylpimelimidate, 18C7 was still able to react with the receptor.

We therefore asked whether IL-4 is able to inhibit TGF-beta induction of FOXP3 during the priming of naive T cells.
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

Human CD4+CD45RA+ T cells were activated with plate-bound anti-CD3/CD28 in the presence of TGF-beta and/or IL-4 and harvested after 5 d. IL-4 efficiently repressed the TGF-beta-mediated induction of FOXP3 expression (Figure 5A) in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 5B).
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

Low levels of GATA3 were induced also in the absence of IL-4, as it was previously observed [3].
('IL-4', 'Negative_regulation', 'GATA3'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'GATA3')

However, at low concentration, IL-4 was able to marginally induce FOXP3 expression.
('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

Of note, GATA3 was also induced in the presence of TGF-beta at high IL-4 concentration (Figure 5A and 5B).
('IL-4', 'Negative_regulation', 'GATA3'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'GATA3')

The IL-4-mediated prevention of FOXP3 expression was not caused by interferences of the receptor signaling, because the phosphorylation of SMAD2 or STAT6 was not affected by the addition of IL-4 and/or TGF-beta, which demonstrates that IL-4 as well as TGF-beta signaling were functional under these conditions (Figure 5C).
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Phosphorylation', 'STAT6'),('IL-4', 'Phosphorylation', 'SMAD2'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Phosphorylation', 'STAT6'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Phosphorylation', 'SMAD2')

Increasing amounts of IL-4 increase intracellular GATA3, whereas FOXP3 decreased, which is consistent with the mRNA analysis (Figure 5D).
('IL-4', 'Negative_regulation', 'GATA3'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'GATA3'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

To study the effects of IL-4 on already-existing human natural or inducible Treg cells, we exposed sorted CD25+ T cells (nTreg cells) to IL-4 and analyzed FOXP3 expression and suppressive capacity.
('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

In already-existing Treg cells, IL-4 failed to inhibit FOXP3 expression (Figure S3A), and the suppressive capacity was not altered (Figure S3C).
('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

Similarly pre-existing iTreg cells did not decrease FOXP3 expression upon IL-4 exposure (Figure S3B).
('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

The gene expression of interferon (IFN)-inducible protein 10 (IP-10) (a CXC chemokine) was markedly augmented by the IFNgamma treatment in PMA- or RA-differentiated U937 cells, but only marginally in undifferentiated or VitD3-treated cells.
('IFNgamma', 'Transcription', 'IP-10'),('IFNgamma', 'Gene_expression', 'IP-10')

In contrast, another inducible gene expression of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (a CC chemokine) and the activation of the transcriptional factor (FcRFgamma) bound to the gamma response region were similarly or less abundantly induced by IFNgamma treatment in PMA- or RA-differentiated U937 cells, indicating that increased IP-10 mRNA induction was not due to the augmented ability of the cells to respond to the presence of IFNgamma.
('IFNgamma', 'Transcription', 'IP-10'),('IFNgamma', 'Gene_expression', 'IP-10'),('IFNgamma', 'Gene_expression', 'monocyte chemotactic protein-1')

Increased expression of IFNgamma-induced IP-10 mRNA following the differentiation of U937 cells was mediated largely by augmented transcriptional activity of the gene and was related to differentiation-dependent changes of the proteins bound to IFN stimulus response element (ISRE) and kB sites, suggesting that these nuclear proteins may determine the IP-10 mRNA inducibility by IFNgamma.
('IFNgamma', 'Transcription', 'IP-10'),('IFNgamma', 'Gene_expression', 'IP-10')

Structure/function analysis of various Oct-2a effector regions in the context of the GAL4 DNA-binding domain revealed that Oct-2a contains two functionally different activation domains at the N and the C termini.
('Oct-2a', 'Positive_regulation', 'Oct-2a')

The possibility that Oct-2a can act as an activator and/or a repressor may have important consequences for the function of Oct-2a in B cell differentiation and other developmental processes.

Glucocorticoids are known to downregulate interleukin-1 beta production in monocytic cells by two different mechanims: direct inhibition of the gene transcription and destabilization of the preformed interleukin-1 beta mRNA.

Cross-linking of CD44 on rheumatoid synovial cells up-regulates VCAM-1.
('CD44', 'Transcription', 'VCAM-1'),('CD44', 'Gene_expression', 'VCAM-1')

Using synovial cells from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, we demonstrated that CD44 cross-linking and binding to hyaluronan augmented VCAM-1 expression and subsequently VCAM-1-mediated cell adhesion.
('CD44', 'Transcription', 'VCAM-1'),('CD44', 'Gene_expression', 'VCAM-1')

Briefly, we found that 1) rheumatoid synovial cells highly expressed CD44; 2) cross-linking of CD44 markedly but transiently augmented VCAM-1 expression and its mRNA transcription much more than did IL-1beta and TNF-alpha; 3) hyaluronan, especially when fragmented, also up-regulated VCAM-1; 4) CD44 activated the transcription factor AP-1; and 5) the integrin-dependent adhesive function of RA synovial cells to T cells was also amplified by CD44 cross-linking.
('CD44', 'Transcription', 'VCAM-1'),('CD44', 'Transcription', 'IL-1beta'),('CD44', 'Gene_expression', 'VCAM-1'),('CD44', 'Transcription', 'TNF-alpha')

These results indicate that the adhesion of RA synovial cells to matrices such as hyaluronic acid through CD44 could up-regulate VCAM-1 expression and VCAM-1-mediated adhesion to T cells, which might in turn cause activation of T cells and synovial cells in RA synovitis.
('CD44', 'Transcription', 'VCAM-1'),('CD44', 'Gene_expression', 'VCAM-1')

This action of the phosphatase inhibitors, which is associated with the activation of the RelA.p50 NF-kappa B heterodimer, is not affected by agents that block the induction of I kappa B alpha phosphorylation by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha).
('TNF-alpha', 'Phosphorylation', 'I kappa B alpha'),('TNF-alpha', 'Protein_catabolism', 'I kappa B alpha')

Furthermore, the phosphorylated I kappa B alpha from calyculin A-treated cells, but not that from TNF-alpha-stimulated cells, is sensitive to PP-2A in vitro, suggesting the existence of fundamental differences in the phosphorylation of I kappa B alpha induced by the two different NF-kappa B inducers.
('TNF-alpha', 'Phosphorylation', 'I kappa B alpha'),('TNF-alpha', 'Protein_catabolism', 'I kappa B alpha')

However, induction of I kappa B alpha phosphorylation by both TNF-alpha and the phosphatase inhibitors is associated with the subsequent degradation of I kappa B alpha.
('TNF-alpha', 'Phosphorylation', 'I kappa B alpha'),('TNF-alpha', 'Protein_catabolism', 'I kappa B alpha')

We further demonstrate that TNF-alpha- and calyculin A-induced I kappa B alpha degradation exhibits similar but not identical sensitivities to a proteasome inhibitor.
('TNF-alpha', 'Phosphorylation', 'I kappa B alpha'),('TNF-alpha', 'Protein_catabolism', 'I kappa B alpha')

Together, these results suggest that phosphorylation of I kappa B alpha, mediated through both the TNF-alpha-inducible and the PP-2A-opposing kinases, may serve to target I kappa B alpha for proteasome-mediated degradation.
('TNF-alpha', 'Phosphorylation', 'I kappa B alpha'),('TNF-alpha', 'Protein_catabolism', 'I kappa B alpha')

TNF-alpha, therefore, emerges as the main factor responsible for a second phase of NF-kappa B regulation, controlling both translocation of p65 and c-rel, and new mRNA synthesis for c-rel and p105/p50.

LMP1 Activates Akt Signaling and Deregulates the Rb Cell Cycle Pathway
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'Akt')

LMP1 transformation of rodent fibroblasts requires activation of PI3K and Akt [5].
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'Akt')

To determine if Akt signaling is activated in LMP1 transgenic mice, pAkt and several of its targets were assessed by immunoblotting of splenic CD19+ MACS-purified B cells.
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'Akt')

LMP1 transgenic B cells had increased levels of pAkt compared to wild-type lymphocytes; however, progression to lymphoma in both LMP1-positive and -negative lymphoma cells did not further increase pAkt levels.
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'Akt')

This finding indicates that GSK3 is not a target of activated Akt in the LMP1 transgenic lymphocytes and lymphoma cells.
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'Akt')

Activated p-mTOR was not increased in LMP1 transgenic lymphocytes or lymphoma cells, indicating that this pathway is not affected by LMP1-induced Akt activation and does not contribute to lymphoma development (Figure 6B).
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'Akt')

Immunoblot analysis indicated that total FoxO1 levels were greatly decreased in wild-type and LMP1 transgenic lymphomas (Figure 6B), suggesting that inhibition of the Forkhead signaling pathway is an important target of Akt in lymphoma development.
('Akt', 'Negative_regulation', 'FoxO1'),('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'Akt')

However, considering that Akt activation did not induce FoxO1 degradation in LMP1 transgenic B cells, Akt may not be the sole regulator of FoxO1, and it may be that progression to lymphoma requires modulation of multiple pathways.
('Akt', 'Negative_regulation', 'FoxO1'),('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'Akt')

The integrin alpha 4 beta 1 can provide a costimulus to induce IL-2 secretion and IL-2R expression leading to enhanced proliferation of purified, peripheral blood T cells.
('integrin alpha 4 beta 1', 'Localization', 'IL-2'),('integrin alpha 4 beta 1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2R')

Although TGF-beta-reduced CD25, IL-4 expression, and CD25 expression (Figure 6B), IL-4 significantly inhibited TGF-beta-mediated induction of FOXP3 in naive T cells driven toward FOXP3+ T cells, as shown by FACS analysis (Figure 6A).
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-4'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'CD25'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Negative_regulation', 'CD25')

It is known that IL-4 is a potent growth factor and may therefore favor the proliferation of FOXP3- cells and thus decrease the relative percentage of FOXP3+ cells.
('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

However, analysis of cell division kinetics by CFSE-labeling demonstrated that IL-4 did not differentially promote cell growth of FOXP3+ over that of FOXP3-.
('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

Furthermore the TGF-beta-mediated induction of FOXP3 expression was not caused by overgrowth of a CD25-FOXP3+ minority, since the number of FOXP3+ cells was low/absent in the purified CD4+CD45RA+ T cells (between 0% and 1%), and the FOXP3+ cells were not confined to the highly divided cells.
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'CD25')

CD25 was down-regulated in TGF-beta-treated cells compare to activated T cells, which was even more pronounced in cells cultured with TGF-beta and IL-4.
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-4'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'CD25'),('IL-4', 'Negative_regulation', 'CD25')

The addition of IL-4 to iTreg-driving conditions decreased the number of FOXP3+ cells (Figure 6B).
('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

In line with the previous findings, the IL-4-producing cells and the FOXP3 expressing cells are nonoverlapping populations.
('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

The expression kinetic of naive T cells exposed to IL-4 and TGF-beta demonstrated that GATA3 and FOXP3 are initially found in separate populations (day 2), but transiently co-express both factors (days 4-8), before establishing separate populations at the end of the differentiation process (day 10; Figure 6C), suggesting that GATA3 inhibits the development of iTreg cells by repressing FOXP3.
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-4'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'GATA3'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'GATA3'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

These results showed that IL-4 acts in vitro as an inhibitor of FOXP3 expression, without interfering with TGF-beta signaling, probably acting at the level of transcription factors, and possibly by a GATA3-dependent mechanism.
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-4'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'GATA3'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'GATA3'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

The up-regulation of IL-1beta message could be mediated by the latent membrane protein-1, EBV nuclear proteins 2, 3, 4, and 6 genes.
('6 genes', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-1beta'),('latent membrane protein-1', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-1beta'),('4', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-1beta'),('EBV nuclear proteins 2', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-1beta'),('3', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-1beta')

Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) demonstrated that the -300 region of the IL-1beta promoter, which contains a nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) binding site, contained a functional RBP binding site.
('3', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-1beta')

In addition, the expression of latent membrane protein-1 led to activation of NF-kappaB that was capable of binding the IL-1beta promoter.
('latent membrane protein-1', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-1beta')

Differential regulation of proto-oncogenes c-jun and c-fos in T lymphocytes activated through CD28.
('CD28', 'Gene_expression', 'c-jun'),('CD28', 'Gene_expression', 'c-fos'),('CD28', 'Positive_regulation', 'c-jun')

In addition to activation of phospholipase C gamma 1, ligation of this receptor also seems to activate a calcium-independent, CD28-specific pathway.
('CD28', 'Positive_regulation', 'phospholipase C gamma 1')

In this paper, we report that cross-linking of CD28 (but not CD2, CD5, LFA-1, or CD7) leads to an elevation of c-jun mRNA, with only minimal activation of c-fos expression.
('CD7', 'Positive_regulation', 'c-jun'),('CD28', 'Gene_expression', 'c-jun'),('CD28', 'Gene_expression', 'c-fos'),('CD28', 'Positive_regulation', 'c-jun'),('CD5', 'Positive_regulation', 'c-jun')

CD28-dependent induction of c-jun expression requires protein tyrosine kinase activity, but does not depend on activation of a phorbol ester-responsive protein kinase C or elevation of cytosolic calcium.
('CD28', 'Gene_expression', 'c-jun'),('CD28', 'Positive_regulation', 'c-jun')

Furthermore, CD28-dependent elevation of c-jun mRNA does not appear to be mediated at the level of mRNA stability.
('CD28', 'Gene_expression', 'c-jun'),('CD28', 'Positive_regulation', 'c-jun')

A mechanism is suggested whereby expression of c-jun and junB, in the absence of members of the fos family, can prevent inappropriate activation of T cells caused by ligation of CD28 in the absence of a specific antigenic stimulus.

IL-10 Production Is Maintained by High TCR Signal Strength and IL-12
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10')

We next investigated whether repeated strong TCR activation is a compensatory signal for IL-12-induced STAT4 signaling in the induction of IL-10 in Th1 cells.
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10')

High antigen dose and IL-12 cooperated to induce maximal IL-10 production (Figures 4A and 4B), given that this combination resulted in the highest numbers of IL-10-producing Th1 cells.
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10')

Repeated high antigen dose stimulation in the absence of exogenously added IL-12 resulted in the production of IL-10 by Th1 cells, suggesting that repeated strong TCR triggering may overcome the need for IL-12 for IL-10 induction (Figures 4C and 4D).
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10')

However, IL-10 induction under these conditions was abrogated when IL-12p40-deficient DCs were used as APCs (Figure 4E).
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12p40', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10')

Thus, IL-12 is essential during both primary and secondary antigenic stimulation for production of IL-10 by Th1 cells.
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10')

To determine the requirements for stability of the IL-10-producing Th1 cells, we differentiated CD4+ T cells for 1 week with high antigen doses with or without IL-12 (Figures 4A and 4C), washed them, and then restimulated them for an additional week with a low antigen dose, in the absence or presence of IL-12 (Figure 4F).
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10')

Th1 cells induced in the first week to produce IL-10 by culture with high antigen doses and IL-12 lost their ability to express IL-10 when recultured with low doses of OVA, which could be compensated for, to some extent, by addition of IL-12 to the secondary cultures (Figure 4F), again suggesting that antigen dose and IL-12 signals cooperate for the induction of IL-10.
('OVA', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10')

Finally, DO11.10 CD4+ cells that were exposed to low doses of antigen and IL-12 during the primary differentiation phase produced high amounts of IFN-gamma but little IL-10, but they could be induced to produce IL-10 when both high antigen dose and IL-12 were present during the recall phase (Figure S4).
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10')

Thus, high antigen dose and IL-12 are required for sustaining the induction of IL-10 production by Th1 cells.
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10')

As shown in Figure 7D, expression of KD-PKCalpha in RAW 264.7 cells did not affect the constitutive phosphorylation at Ser536 of NF-kappaB p65, but attenuated the phosphorylation at Ser276.
('PKCalpha', 'Phosphorylation', 'p65')

These observations demonstrate that PKCalpha is important in M-CSF-regulated cell survival and NF-kappaB activation and likely regulated through phosphorylation of Ser276 of NF-kappaB p65.
('PKCalpha', 'Phosphorylation', 'p65')

To further validate the impact that PKCalpha played in M-CSF-induced NF-kappaB transcriptional activity, we next employed PKCalpha siRNA treatment of MDM or RAW cells.
('PKCalpha siRNA', 'Gene_expression', 'PKCalpha')

A pool of specific PKCalpha siRNA were transfected into MDM or Raw 264.7 cells in the presence or absence or M-CSF.
('PKCalpha siRNA', 'Gene_expression', 'PKCalpha')

We also examined cell survival of the MDMs by Annexin V-FITC and PI staining after PKCalpha siRNA transfection.
('PKCalpha siRNA', 'Gene_expression', 'PKCalpha')

As shown in Figure 7G, M-CSF-induced MDM survival was reduced in the cells transfected with PKCalpha siRNA compared with cells transfected with control siRNA (p = 0.047).
('PKCalpha siRNA', 'Gene_expression', 'PKCalpha')

In Figure 7H, we confirmed that PKCalpha siRNA transfection decreased PKCalpha protein expression in both MDM and Raw 264.7 cells.
('PKCalpha siRNA', 'Gene_expression', 'PKCalpha')

In contrast, IFN-gamma priming did not affect the expression of p105 transcripts but enhanced the expression of p65 mRNA (two-fold).
('IFN-gamma', 'Gene_expression', 'p65')

Priming with IFN-gamma followed by LPS stimulation resulted in a further increase in the expression of p65 mRNA.
('IFN-gamma', 'Gene_expression', 'p65')

Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) demonstrated that unstimulated monocytes predominantly expressed p50 NF-kappa B. Stimulation with LPS or IFN-gamma resulted in the expression of p50 and p65 subunits, while the combination of IFN-gamma plus LPS caused a further increase in the expression of NF-kappa B.
('IFN-gamma', 'Gene_expression', 'p65'),('IFN-gamma', 'Gene_expression', 'p50')

With Western blotting, it was shown that nuclear extracts from monocytes contained p50 and p65 protein in response to LPS and IFN-gamma stimulation.
('IFN-gamma', 'Gene_expression', 'p65'),('IFN-gamma', 'Gene_expression', 'p50')

The effects of IFN-gamma on the transcription factors were specific, since no change was observed in the expression of NF-IL-6 or I kappa B alpha, the inhibitor of NF-kappa B.

Role of CBFbeta in the induction of Foxp3
('CBFbeta', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3')

To target all Runx proteins that might be involved in the induction of Foxp3, we used mice in which loxP-flanked Cbfb alleles were inactivated in T cells through expression of a CD4-cre transgene.
('Runx', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3'),('Runx', 'Positive_regulation', 'Foxp3')

Retinoic acid and TGF-beta synergize in the induction of Foxp3 in naive T cells (Kang et al., 2007).
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3')

To investigate whether Runx-mediated induction of Foxp3 is dependent on the expression of CBFbeta, naive CD4+ CD8- T cells from CbfbF/F CD4-cre and control CbfbF/+ CD4-cre mice were stimulated with anti-CD3/28 mAbs, retinoic acid, and increasing concentrations of TGF-beta.
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3'),('Runx', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3'),('CBFbeta', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3'),('Runx', 'Positive_regulation', 'Foxp3')

After 3 d in culture, the cells were restimulated with PMA and ionomycin and analyzed for intracellular Foxp3 and IFN-gamma expression.
('IFN-gamma', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3')

TGF-beta induced Foxp3 in CbfbF/+ CD4-cre cells in a dose dependent manner, and this was significantly reduced in CbfbF/F CD4-cre cells.
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3')

Retinoic acid enhanced Foxp3 expression even in 20 pg/ml of TGF-beta and more than 95% of the CD4+ T cells from CbfbF/+ CD4-cre mice became Foxp3+ in 100 and 500 pg/ml TGF-beta doses.
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3')

The induction of Foxp3 was again significantly lower in CbfbF/F CD4-cre CD4+ T cells even in the presence of retinoic acid, demonstrating that deficiency in Runx binding to DNA affects the TGF-beta induction of Foxp3 in T reg cells (Fig.
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3'),('Runx', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3'),('Runx', 'Positive_regulation', 'Foxp3')

There was no difference in the induction of Foxp3 when endogenous IL-4 and IFN-gamma were neutralized (Fig.
('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3'),('IFN-gamma', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3')

The importance of RUNX transcription factors for the in vivo conversion of naive CD4+ T cells into iT reg cells was examined.
('RUNX', 'Gene_expression', 'CD4')

These data affirm the significance of RUNX proteins for the in vivo generation of CD4+ Foxp3+ T cells.
('RUNX', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3'),('RUNX', 'Gene_expression', 'CD4')

In this investigation an enhanced and prolonged IL-2 and IL-2 mRNA response was also detected in both stimulated (T cell mitogens or alloantigens) murine splenocytes and in the stimulated murine T cell line EL-4 in the presence of ciprofloxacin (5-80 micrograms/ml) as compared to control cells without antibiotics.
('IL-2', 'Transcription', 'IL-2')

Taken together, cipro inhibited IFN-gamma synthesis, but enhanced IL-2 production in murine lymphocytes by means of influencing NFAT-1 and causing an increased IL-2 transcription.
('NFAT-1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2'),('IL-2', 'Transcription', 'IL-2')

Two distinct signalling pathways are involved in the control of the biphasic junB transcription induced by interleukin-6 in the B cell hybridoma 7TD1.
('interleukin-6', 'Transcription', 'junB')

We have measured the level of junB mRNA in the B hybridoma cell line 7TD1, under interleukin-6 (IL-6) stimulation.
('interleukin-6', 'Transcription', 'junB'),('IL-6', 'Transcription', 'junB')

IL-6 increases junB mRNA in a biphasic fashion.
('IL-6', 'Transcription', 'junB')

The first early-induced peak was transient and likely corresponds to the well documented typical junB mRNA, stimulated in response to numerous growth factors, including IL-6.
('IL-6', 'Transcription', 'junB')

As a consequence of its effect on junB mRNA, IL-6 stimulated, in a biphasic fashion, the nuclear accumulation of the JunB protein.
('junB', 'Localization', 'JunB'),('IL-6', 'Transcription', 'junB')

In this study, we demonstrated that IL-6 regulation occurred exclusively at the transcriptional level and that the bimodal increase of junB mRNA and JunB protein can be accounted for by a biphasic stimulation of junB transcription.
('junB', 'Localization', 'JunB'),('IL-6', 'Transcription', 'junB')

Furthermore, our data point to two major differences between the mechanism of control of the early and the late IL-6-induced junB transcription waves.
('IL-6', 'Transcription', 'junB')

Altogether these data indicate that, in 7TD1 cells, IL-6 controls junB transcription in a biphasic fashion by means of two separate transduction pathways.
('IL-6', 'Transcription', 'junB')

We found that overexpression of IkappaB-alpha in endothelial cells using a recombinant adenovirus prevented tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)-induced degradation of IkappaB-alpha and suppressed the upregulation of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and E-selectin mRNA and surface protein expression and the upregulation of transcripts for the chemokines monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) and growth-related activity-alpha (GRO-alpha) by TNF-alpha.
('TNF-alpha', 'Transcription', 'GRO-alpha'),('TNF-alpha', 'Transcription', 'MCP-1'),('TNF-alpha', 'Protein_catabolism', 'IkappaB-alpha')

Adhesion assays under physiological shear flow conditions showed that firm arrest, spreading, and transmigration of monocytes on TNF-alpha-activated endothelium was markedly inhibited by IkappaB-alpha overexpression.

Immunoprecipitation of epitope-labeled BKO demonstrated for the formation of a tight complex with endogenous B subunit in Jurkat cells, consistent with an inhibitory mechanism that involves the sequestration of the B subunit.

Runx3 controls Eomes, perforin, granzyme B, and IFN-gamma expression in effector CTLs.
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'granzyme B'),('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'Eomes'),('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma')

Runx3+/+ or Runx3-/- CD8+ T cells were activated and transduced with retroviruses bearing an empty IRES-GFP cassette (GFP) or also encoding Eomes-VP16 (Eo-VP16) or Myc-Runx3 (Runx3).
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'Eomes')

T-bet is induced by TCR signals and is essential for early IFN-gamma expression.
('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma')

Runx3 is present in naive CD8+ T cells and represses Runx1 and induces Eomes, perforin, granzyme B, and IFN-gamma expression.
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'granzyme B'),('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'Eomes'),('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma')

Eomes may participate in sustaining late IFN-gamma expression, whereas Runx3 and Eomes (but not T-bet) may cooperate to activate perforin expression.
('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'Eomes'),('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma')

The dotted line indicates the partial effect of T-bet deficiency on Gzmb mRNA but not granzyme B protein expression.
('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'Gzmb'),('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'granzyme B')

In contrast to the decrease in GR mRNA seen in IM-9 cells after treatment with 1 microM dexamethasone for 16-18 h, treatment of 6TG1.1 cells resulted in an 8-fold increase in GR mRNA, as determined by Northern blot and RNase protection analysis, with a corresponding 3- to 4-fold increase in GR protein.
('GR', 'Gene_expression', 'GR')

Half-maximal induction of GR mRNA and protein in 6TG1.1 cells was observed between 10-100 nM dexamethasone, and inclusion of 1 microM RU 38486 completely blocked the effects of 100 nM dexamethasone, demonstrating that positive autoregulation of GR expression in 6TG1.1 cells is a receptor-mediated response.
('GR', 'Gene_expression', 'GR')

Positive autoregulation of GR expression was also observed in glucocorticoid-resistant CEM-C1 cells, which contain functional GR, but whose growth is unaffected by glucocorticoids.
('GR', 'Gene_expression', 'GR')

It represses Runx1 and has a positive role in the induction of Eomes, granzyme B, perforin, and IFN-gamma.
('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin')

Additional experiments are needed to determine whether Eomes and Runx1 are also direct target genes of Runx3.
('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'Eomes')

Surprisingly, Runx3 contributed to the optimal expression of TNF, IL-2, and IFN-gamma at day 4 (Fig.
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'TNF')

For TNF and IL-2, the requirement for Runx3 subsides by day 6 (Fig.
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'TNF')

Runx3 continues to be required for IFN-gamma expression even at day 6, perhaps because of its role in the induction of Eomes expression (Fig.
('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'Eomes'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'IFN-gamma')

T-bet is needed early to confer on activated CD8+ T cells the competence to produce IFN-gamma upon restimulation, but its function is less important at later times.
('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma')

Eomes, which is induced late and functions downstream of Runx3, may substitute for T-bet in promoting the acute expression of IFN-gamma in restimulated CTLs (8).
('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'Eomes'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'IFN-gamma'),('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma')

Indeed, T-bet and Eomes both contribute to perforin expression in NK cells (8, 26), and Eomes induces granzyme B as effectively as T-bet in developing Th2 cells (7); thus, the relative roles of these T-box transcription factors vary depending on cell type.
('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'granzyme B')

Surprisingly, however, Eomes and T-bet appeared nonredundant in their ability to induce two other markers of CTL function, Prf1 and Gzmb (Fig.
('Eomes', 'Positive_regulation', 'Prf1'),('T-bet', 'Positive_regulation', 'Gzmb')

Rather, T-bet and Eomes were involved in regulating granzyme B and perforin expression, respectively: up-regulation of T-bet and Eomes mRNA and protein closely preceded up-regulation of Gzmb and Prf1 mRNA and protein, respectively.
('Eomes', 'Positive_regulation', 'Prf1'),('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'granzyme B'),('T-bet', 'Positive_regulation', 'Gzmb')

T-bet had no role in perforin expression under our culture conditions, and Eo-VP16 did not affect granzyme B expression when expressed in T-bet-/- or Runx3-/- cells.
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'granzyme B'),('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'granzyme B'),('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'perforin'),('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'granzyme B'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Eo-VP16', 'Gene_expression', 'granzyme B')

Because conventional Eomes-deficient mice die before precursor cells can be isolated for bone marrow transfers (27) and because T cells conditionally deficient in Eomes have only recently been described (9), we were unable to introduce Runx3 into Eomes-deficient CD8+ T cells to test formally whether Eomes cooperated with Runx3 to induce perforin expression.
('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'Eomes'),('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin')

Collectively, our data are consistent with a transcriptional network in which preexisting Runx3 cooperates with the induced T-box factors T-bet and Eomes and IL-2Rbeta signals (unpublished data) to orchestrate CTL differentiation (Fig.
('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'Eomes'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2')

Our data recall the "feed-forward" interaction between T-bet and Runx3 that we previously described in CD4+ (Th1) T cells (15) but are distinct in two respects: in differentiating Th1 cells, T-bet is induced by TCR signals and IFN-gamma, and in turn induces Runx3 (15), whereas in differentiating CD8+ T cells, preexisting Runx3 is required to induce the T-box transcription factor Eomes.

Cross-linking CD40 on B cells can lead to homotypic cell adhesion, IL-6 production, and, in combination with cytokines, to Ig isotype switching.

Furthermore, Tax-induced transactivation of the bcl-x promoter was also diminished by the mutant IkappaBalpha, which specifically inhibits NF-kappaB activity.

Immunodepletion studies show that PTF beta is required for transcription of both classes of snRNA genes in vitro.
('PTF beta', 'Transcription', 'snRNA')

This result suggests that the cAMP response element binding protein, CREB, is involved in the protein-TRE-DNA complex and in mediating the Tax response.
('CREB', 'Regulation', 'Tax')

On the other hand, the up-regulation of CD80 Ag, found on monocytes obtained from PBMC incubated with OKT3, is not detected after addition of IL-10, and the anti-CD28 mAb CLB-CD28/1 restores the NF-kappa B/Rel nuclear activity in IL-10-inhibited lymphocytes.

Jak3 is associated with CD40 and is critical for CD40 induction of gene expression in B cells.
('CD40', 'Phosphorylation', 'Jak3'),('CD40', 'Binding', 'Jak3'),('CD40', 'Positive_regulation', 'Jak3')

We show that engagement of CD40 induces tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of Jak3 as well as of STAT3.
('CD40', 'Phosphorylation', 'Jak3'),('CD40', 'Phosphorylation', 'STAT3'),('CD40', 'Positive_regulation', 'STAT3'),('CD40', 'Binding', 'Jak3'),('CD40', 'Positive_regulation', 'Jak3')

Jak3 is constitutively associated with CD40, and this interaction requires a proline-rich sequence in the membrane-proximal region of CD40.
('CD40', 'Phosphorylation', 'Jak3'),('CD40', 'Binding', 'Jak3'),('CD40', 'Positive_regulation', 'Jak3')

Deletion of this sequence abolishes the capacity of CD40 to induce expression of CD23, ICAM-1, and lymphotoxin-alpha genes in B cells.
('CD40', 'Gene_expression', 'lymphotoxin-alpha'),('CD40', 'Gene_expression', 'CD23'),('CD40', 'Gene_expression', 'ICAM-1')

These results indicate that signaling through Jak3 is activated by CD40 and plays an important role in CD40-mediated functions.

Cell adhesion to endothelial cells stimulated by tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) is due to induction of surface receptors, such as vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1).
('TNF', 'Gene_expression', 'VCAM-1'),('TNF', 'Transcription', 'VCAM-1')

Since kappa B motifs are present in VCAM-1 and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) promoters, we used PDTC to study the regulatory mechanisms of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 induction and subsequent monocyte adhesion in TNF-treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs).
('TNF', 'Gene_expression', 'VCAM-1'),('TNF', 'Transcription', 'ICAM-1'),('TNF', 'Transcription', 'VCAM-1'),('TNF', 'Gene_expression', 'ICAM-1')

PDTC or N-acetylcysteine dose dependently reduced TNF-induced VCAM-1 but not ICAM-1 surface protein (also in human umbilical arterial endothelial cells) and mRNA expression (by 70% at 100 mumol/L PDTC) in HUVECs as assessed by flow cytometry and polymerase chain reaction.
('TNF', 'Gene_expression', 'VCAM-1'),('TNF', 'Transcription', 'ICAM-1'),('TNF', 'Transcription', 'VCAM-1'),('TNF', 'Gene_expression', 'ICAM-1')

Gel-shift analysis in HUVECs demonstrated that PDTC prevented NF-kappa B mobilization by TNF, suggesting that only VCAM-1 induction was controlled by NF-kappa B.
('TNF', 'Gene_expression', 'VCAM-1'),('TNF', 'Transcription', 'VCAM-1')

Since HUVECs released superoxide anions in response to TNF, and H2O2 induces VCAM-1, PDTC may act as a radical scavenger.
('TNF', 'Gene_expression', 'VCAM-1'),('TNF', 'Transcription', 'VCAM-1')

Although ICAM-1 induction was unaffected, inhibitors of NADPH oxidase (apocynin) or cytochrome P-450 (SKF525a) suppressed VCAM-1 induction by TNF, revealing that several radical-generating systems are involved in its regulation.

HOIP is required for CD40-mediated CD80 upregulation and activation of germline epsilon transcription
('CD40', 'Gene_expression', 'CD80'),('HOIP', 'Positive_regulation', 'CD80'),('CD40', 'Positive_regulation', 'CD80')

Engagement of CD40 on B cells upregulates expression of CD80 [10], a cell surface protein that promotes activation of T cells interacting with B cells and other APC.
('CD40', 'Gene_expression', 'CD80'),('CD40', 'Positive_regulation', 'CD80')

To begin evaluating potential contributions of HOIP to CD40 signaling, we assayed the upregulation of CD80 induced by engagement of CD40 on parental A20.2J, HOIP-deficient, and HOIP-reconstituted cells (Fig.
('CD40', 'Gene_expression', 'CD80'),('HOIP', 'Positive_regulation', 'CD80'),('CD40', 'Positive_regulation', 'CD80')

Compared to the parental cell line, the CD40-stimulated upregulation of CD80 was dramatically reduced in all HOIP-deficient cells tested.

In contrast, upregulation of CD80 was restored in HOIP-reconstituted cells, confirming that the defect in CD80 upregulation in the HOIP-deficient cells was due to the disruption of Rnf31.

CTLA-4 engagement by mAbs inhibits, while CD28 enhances, IL-2 production and proliferation upon T cell activation.
('CD28', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-2'),('CTLA-4', 'Transcription', 'IL-2')

CTLA-4 ligation inhibited CD3/CD28-induced IL-2 mRNA accumulation by inhibiting IL-2 transcription, which appears to be mediated in part through decreasing NF-AT accumulation in the nuclei.
('CD28', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-2'),('CTLA-4', 'Transcription', 'IL-2')

However, CTLA-4 ligation did not appear to affect the CD28-mediated stabilization of IL-2 mRNA.
('CD28', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-2'),('CTLA-4', 'Transcription', 'IL-2')

Further, CTLA-4 engagement inhibited progression through the cell cycle by inhibiting the production of cyclin D3, cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk)4, and cdk6 when the T cells were stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28 and with anti-CD3 alone.
('CTLA-4', 'Gene_expression', 'cyclin D3'),('CTLA-4', 'Gene_expression', '(cdk)4'),('CTLA-4', 'Gene_expression', 'cdk6')

These results indicate that CTLA-4 signaling inhibits events early in T cell activation both at IL-2 transcription and at the level of IL-2-independent events of the cell cycle, and does not simply oppose CD28-mediated costimulation.

IKKbeta phosphorylation regulates RPS3 nuclear translocation and NF-kappaB function duringEscherichia coliO157:H7 infection
('IKKbeta', 'Localization', 'RPS3'),('IKKbeta', 'Protein_modification', 'RPS3')

Here we report that IKKbeta phosphorylation of serine 209 (S209) was crucial for RPS3 nuclear localization in response to activating stimuli.
('IKKbeta', 'Localization', 'RPS3'),('IKKbeta', 'Protein_modification', 'RPS3')

Moreover, the foodborne pathogen Escherichia coli O157:H7 virulence protein NleH1 specifically inhibited RPS3 S209 phosphorylation and blocked RPS3 function, thereby promoting bacterial colonization and diarrhea but decreasing mortality in a gnotobiotic piglet infection model.
('NleH1', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('RPS3', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

Thus, the IKKbeta-dependent modification of a specific amino acid in RPS3 promotes specific NF-kappaB functions that underlie the molecular pathogenetic mechanisms of E. coli O157:H7.

Tat associates with p65 increasing its DNA-affinity binding.
('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65')

(A) HeLa cells were transfected with pRc/CMV-3xHA-p65 (5 microg) in presence or absence of p3xFLAG-Tat, p3xFLAG-Tat T,N(23,24)A, p3xFLAG-Tat K(50,51)A, p3xFLAG-Tat R(49-57)A, or p3xFLAG-Tat C(22,25,27)A (5 microg).

('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65')

(D) HeLa cells were transfected with p3xFLAG-Tat (5 microg) in the presence or absence of pRc/CMV-3xHA-p65, pRc/CMV-3xHA-p65deltaC (1-318), or pRc/CMV-3xHA-p65deltaN (122-551) (5 microg).

Transcription-independent turnover of I kappa B alpha during monocyte adherence: implications for a translational component regulating I kappa B alpha/MAD-3 mRNA levels.
('I kappa B alpha', 'Positive_regulation', 'I kappa B alpha')

The demonstration that NF-kappa B can regulate I kappa B alpha/MAD-3 gene transcription in other cell types suggested that the rapid increase in steady-state I kappa B alpha/MAD-3 mRNA levels we observed within 30 min of monocyte adherence would result from NF-kappa B-dependent transcriptional stimulation of the I kappa B alpha/MAD-3 gene.
('I kappa B alpha', 'Positive_regulation', 'I kappa B alpha')

Interestingly, while increases in both IL-1 beta and I kappa B alpha/MAD-3 mRNA levels were detected in nuclei of adherent monocytes, cytoplasmic levels of IL-1 beta mRNA increased during adherence whereas those of I kappa B alpha/MAD-3 mRNA did not.
('I kappa B alpha', 'Positive_regulation', 'I kappa B alpha')

We propose that adherent monocytes regulate nuclear processing (or decay) of I kappa B alpha/MAD-3 mRNA, thereby increasing mRNA levels without stimulating I kappa B alpha/MAD-3 gene transcription.
('I kappa B alpha', 'Positive_regulation', 'I kappa B alpha')

Moreover, since inhibition of protein synthesis leads to accumulation of I kappa B alpha/MAD-3 mRNA without stimulating I kappa B alpha/MAD-3 gene transcription, we suggest that low cytoplasmic levels of I kappa B alpha/MAD-3 mRNA are maintained by a translation-dependent degradation mechanism.
('I kappa B alpha', 'Positive_regulation', 'I kappa B alpha')

Specific inhibitors of p38alpha MAPk blocked LPS-induced adhesion, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) activation, and synthesis of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha).
('p38alpha MAPk', 'Gene_expression', 'TNF-alpha')

Inhibition of p38alpha MAPk resulted in a transient decrease in TNF-alpha mRNA accumulation but persistent loss of TNF-alpha synthesis.
('p38alpha MAPk', 'Gene_expression', 'TNF-alpha')

These findings support a pathway by which LPS stimulation of neutrophils results in activation of MKK3, which in turn activates p38alpha MAPk, ultimately regulating adhesion, NF-kappaB activation, enhanced gene expression of TNF-alpha, and regulation of TNF-alpha synthesis.
('p38alpha MAPk', 'Gene_expression', 'TNF-alpha')

IL-10 Production by Th1 Cells Requires ERK1 and ERK2 Activation
('ERK2', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('ERK1', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10')

Our data showed that the maintenance of IL-10 induction in Th1 cells required stimulation with high antigen dose, which to some extent could be compensated for by the addition of IL-12.
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Although the apparent peak and amount of ERK1 and ERK2 activation varied slightly between experiments, a consistent finding was that high antigen dose differentiated Th1 cells always showed enhanced and prolonged ERK1 and ERK2 activation in the presence of IL-12, regardless of whether they were restimulated with high or low antigen dose (Figure 5B).
('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'ERK1'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'ERK2')

We then investigated whether ERK1 and ERK2 activation was required for the induction of IL-10 in Th1 cells by using U0126 (Figure 5C), a compound that blocks downstream ERK activation.
('ERK2', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('ERK1', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10')

As in the APC-driven cultures, stronger TCR stimulation together with IL-12 led to higher percentages of cells producing both IL-10 and IFN-gamma after 1 week of culture (Figure 5C).
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Because U0126 inhibits the MEK5-catalyzed activation of ERK5, as well as the MEK1- and MEK2-catalyzed activation of ERK1 and ERK2 (Bain et al., 2007; Mody et al., 2001), we also used the more specific, structurally unrelated MEK1 and MEK2 inhibitor PD184352 at concentrations in which it inhibits MEK1 and MEK2 but not MEK5 (Bain et al., 2007; Mody et al., 2001).
('MEK2', 'Positive_regulation', 'ERK1'),('MEK5', 'Positive_regulation', 'ERK5'),('MEK1', 'Positive_regulation', 'ERK2'),('MEK1', 'Positive_regulation', 'ERK1'),('MEK2', 'Positive_regulation', 'ERK2')

Upon addition of inhibitors to other signaling pathways, including a p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB203580, or the GSK3beta inhibitor, CT99021 (Bain et al., 2007), no effect on IL-10 production was observed (Figure S5B).
('p38 MAPK', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('GSK3beta', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Our data thus suggested that IL-10 production by Th1 cells in response to high antigen dose and IL-12 requires ERK1 and ERK2 signaling, but not the activation of the p38 or the GSK3beta pathways.

BMP-6 induces upregulation of Id1
('BMP-6', 'Positive_regulation', 'Id1')

Next, we wanted to explore whether the BMP-6 induced phosphorylation of Smad 1/5/8 also could induce transcriptional changes of target genes.
('BMP-6', 'Phosphorylation', 'Smad 1'),('BMP-6', 'Phosphorylation', '8'),('BMP-6', 'Phosphorylation', '5')

Thus, B cells were pre-incubated over night in X-VIVO 15, and then cultured in medium alone or in the presence of BMP-6 for various time points before preparation of total RNA.
('BMP-6', 'Phosphorylation', '5')

Interestingly, we observed a specific four-fold upregulation of Id1 mRNA in BMP-6-treated B cells (Figure 7).
('BMP-6', 'Positive_regulation', 'Id1')

The up-regulation of Id1 mRNA was characteristic of an early inducible gene, with maximal upregulation two hours after the addition of BMP-6 and returned to baseline after 24 hours.
('BMP-6', 'Positive_regulation', 'Id1')

Western blot analysis revealed that the BMP-6-induced upregulation of Id1 mRNA also was correlated with upregulation of Id1 protein as well.
('Id1', 'Positive_regulation', 'Id1'),('BMP-6', 'Positive_regulation', 'Id1')

The increase in Id1 protein level was detectable after one hour and increased until 24 hours after BMP-6 addition, showing a 16-fold upregulation compared with t0 (p <= 0.020, n = 4) (Figure 8 and 9).
('BMP-6', 'Phosphorylation', '8'),('BMP-6', 'Positive_regulation', 'Id1')

Taken together, these data suggest that Id1 could be a possible target gene for mediating the effects of BMP-6 in human B cells, whereas Id2 and Id3 not seem to be involved.

Tat relieves p65 from the IkappaB-alpha inhibition.
('Tat', 'Negative_regulation', 'p65')

(C) 35S-methionine-labeled p65 (5 microl) was incubated with in vitro translated HA-IkappaB-alpha (5 microl) in presence or absence of FLAG-Tat or FLAG-Tat R(49-57)A (5, 10 or 20 microl).
('HA-IkappaB-alpha', 'Binding', 'p65'),('Tat', 'Negative_regulation', 'p65')

HA-IkappaB-alpha was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody; immunocomplexes were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and analysed by western blotting with anti-HA and anti-FLAG antibodies, or autoradiography (35S-Met-p65).
('HA-IkappaB-alpha', 'Binding', 'p65')

32P-labeled-NF-kappaB double-stranded oligonucleotide was incubated with p65 (0.5 microl) in presence or absence of HA-IkappaB-alpha (1 microl), FLAG-Tat or FLAG-Tat R(49-57)A (5 and 10 microl); competition of DNA binding was performed with 10 - up to 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled NF-kappaB double-stranded oligonucleotide.

Human immunodeficiency virus-1 Tat activates NF-kappaB via physical interaction with IkappaB-alpha and p65
('Tat', 'Binding', 'IkappaB-alpha'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65')

We report that in single round HIV-1 infection, or single-pulse PMA stimulation, the HIV-1 Tat transactivator activated NF-kappaB by hijacking the inhibitor IkappaB-alpha and by preventing the repressor binding to the NF-kappaB complex.
('Tat', 'Binding', 'IkappaB-alpha')

Moreover, Tat associated with the p65 subunit of NF-kappaB and increased the p65 DNA-binding affinity and transcriptional activity.
('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65')

The arginine- and cysteine-rich domains of Tat were required for IkappaB-alpha and p65 association, respectively, and for sustaining the NF-kappaB activity.
('Tat', 'Binding', 'IkappaB-alpha'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65')

Among an array of NF-kappaB-responsive genes, Tat mostly activated the MIP-1alpha expression in a p65-dependent manner, and bound to the MIP-1alpha NF-kappaB enhancer thus promoting the recruitment of p65 with displacement of IkappaB-alpha; similar findings were obtained for the NF-kappaB-responsive genes CSF3, LTA, NFKBIA and TLR2.
('Tat', 'Binding', 'IkappaB-alpha'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'MIP-1alpha'),('p65', 'Gene_expression', ' MIP-1alpha')

Our results support a novel mechanism of NF-kappaB activation via physical interaction of Tat with IkappaB-alpha and p65, and may contribute to further insights into the deregulation of the inflammatory response by HIV-1.
('Tat', 'Binding', 'IkappaB-alpha'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65')

The defective NF-kappaB activation by both stimuli suggests that the Sharpin mutation interferes with the protein adaptors or kinases shared by both signaling pathways, such as RIP1 and TRAF6 [18].
('Sharpin', 'Ubiquitination', 'RIP1')

Our results indicate that the protein HOIP is critical for CD40-induced signals that regulate B cell function.
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40')

Our data show that HOIP-dependent cellular responses include CD40-mediated upregulation of CD80 expression and synthesis of germline RNA transcripts from the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus, two events that are important for T-cell-dependent antibody-mediated immune responses.
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40')

At the molecular level, our data indicate that HOIP functions downstream of TRAF2 in the CD40 signaling pathway and that HOIP has a key role in promoting the recruitment of the IKK complex to CD40.
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40'),('TRAF2', 'Binding', 'HOIP')

Consistent with this, CD40-induced activation of NF-kappaB is dependent on the presence of HOIP.
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40')

In addition, our data show that HOIP facilitates the activation of JNK in response to CD40 engagement.
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40')

Together, our findings provide support for the conclusion that HOIP is a key component of the CD40 signaling pathway.
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40')

Given the importance of CD40 signaling in both cellular and humoral immune responses, our results indicate that HOIP has a critical role in the regulation of the immune system.
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40')

Subsequent studies showed that a HOIP-containing complex can interact with IKKgamma and facilitate activation of NF-kappaB via the canonical pathway [16].
('HOIP', 'Positive_regulation', 'IKKgamma')

These data, considered together with ours, suggest that a HOIP-containing complex mediates recruitment of IKKgamma to the CD40 signaling complex.
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40'),('HOIP', 'Positive_regulation', 'IKKgamma')

In addition, CD40-associated HOIP could play a role in activating IKKgamma after its recruitment to the signaling complex [16].
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40'),('HOIP', 'Positive_regulation', 'IKKgamma')

The higher molecular weight forms of IKKgamma we observed in CD40 immunoprecipitates would be consistent with the presence of post-transcriptional modifications including phosphorylation and ubiquitination, which have been suggested to reduce or enhance IKKgamma activity, respectively [16], [17].
('IKKgamma', 'Positive_regulation', 'IKKgamma'),('IKKgamma', 'Negative_regulation', 'IKKgamma')

The mechanisms by which HOIP mediates recruitment of the IKK complex to CD40 and by which HOIP is recruited to CD40 remain unclear.
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40')

A previous study indicates that HOIP may mediate direct contacts with the IKK complex [16], suggesting that it functions as an adaptor for the recruitment of the IKK complex to CD40.
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40')

As IKKgamma appears capable of binding linear polyubiquitin [18], [19], it is possible that HOIP directs formation of linear polyubiquitin chains on a CD40-associated factor, and it is these chains that serve to recruit IKKgamma to the CD40 signaling complex.
('IKKgamma', 'Positive_regulation', 'IKKgamma'),('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40'),('IKKgamma', 'Negative_regulation', 'IKKgamma'),('HOIP', 'Positive_regulation', 'IKKgamma')

The molecular interactions necessary for recruitment of HOIP itself to the CD40 signaling complex also remain to be fully characterized.
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40')

We previously showed that the recruitment of HOIP to the signaling complex is TRAF2-dependent [8].
('TRAF2', 'Binding', 'HOIP')

Potentially, TRAF2 and HOIP directly interact, but it is possible that the ubiquitin ligase activity of TRAF2 [20] (or TRAF2-associated proteins, such as the cIAPs [21]) generates K63-linked polyubiquitin chains to which HOIP can bind and thus associate with the CD40 signaling complex [22].
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40'),('TRAF2', 'Binding', 'HOIP')

While our previous work indicated a potentially important link between TRAF2 and HOIP in CD40 signaling, the signals and functions tested here are dependent upon TRAF6 as well as TRAF2.
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40'),('TRAF2', 'Binding', 'HOIP')

HOIP deficiency compromises the CD40-mediated activation of both NF-kappaB and JNK, indicating that signals mediated by both TRAF2 and TRAF6 likely pass through HOIP.
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40'),('TRAF2', 'Binding', 'HOIP')

Although the experiments presented here focus on CD40, our results and those of other groups [16], [22] support the possibility that HOIP is important in many signaling pathways in which TRAF2 or TRAF6 are involved, including those associated with various members of the TNF receptor superfamily and the Toll-like receptors.
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40'),('TRAF2', 'Binding', 'HOIP')

GATA3 Represses the FOXP3 Promoter
('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

To investigate the molecular mechanism of GATA3-mediated repression of human FOXP3, the human FOXP3 promoter was studied and a palindromic binding site for GATA3 was discovered.
('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('FOXP3', 'Regulation', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

We transfected human primary CD4+ T cells, in vitro differentiated Th2 cells, and Jurkat cells (Jurkat cells are known to constitutively express GATA3 [25,26]), and we measured FOXP3 promoter activity.
('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

Overexpression of GATA3 in naive T cells diminished luciferase activity of the FOXP3 promoter compared with the control vector (Figure 8B).
('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

This mutation increased luciferase activity by 3-fold in memory CD4+CD45RO+ T cells, whereas no difference was observed in naive (GATA3-) CD4+CD45RA+ T cells, revealing a repressor activity of GATA3 on the FOXP3 promoter (Figure 8C).
('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

Furthermore GATA3 binds directly to the FOXP3 promoter as investigated by pull-down assay.
('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

HEK cells were transiently transfected with GATA3 or a control vector, and increasing amounts of lysates were incubated with oligonucleotides containing the GATA3 site of the FOXP3 promoter or a control oligonucleotide with a mutated GATA3-binding site.
('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

These experiments demonstrated that GATA3 binds the palindromic FOXP3 promoter.
('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

To gain insights into the in vivo situation, we performed a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) using an anti-GATA3 antibody and showed that GATA3 binds to the FOXP3 promoter region in Th2 cells, but not in iTreg cells (Figure 7F).
('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

Taken together these data demonstrate that the GATA3-binding to the FOXP3 promoter is repressing FOXP3 expression.

3.5 microg of the FOXP3 promoter luciferase reporter vector or a combination together with the RUNX1, RUNX3 pEGFPN1 vector, and 0.5 microg phRL-TK were added to 3 x 106 CD4+ T cells resuspended in 100 microl of Nucleofector solution (Lonza) and electroporated using the program U-15.

Costimulatory signals, such as activation of the CD28 cell surface molecule on T cells, lead to activation through a distinct region of the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) promoter.
('CD28', 'Positive_regulation', 'granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor')

We have found that the HTLV-1 transactivator protein, tax, acts as a costimulatory signal for GM-CSF and IL-2 gene transcription, in that it can cooperate with TCR signals to mediate high level gene expression.
('tax', 'Transcription', 'IL-2'),('tax', 'Transcription', 'GM-CSF')

In vitro human CD4+ and CD8+ T cell clones, or mouse CD4+ T cells that produce both interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and IL-10, can be differentiated by T cell receptor (TCR)-stimulation in the presence of IL-12 (Chang et al., 2007; Gerosa et al., 1996; Jeannin et al., 1996; Meyaard et al., 1996; Windhagen et al., 1996).
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma')

Th1 cell development requires signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)1 activation, induced by type I IFN or IFN-gamma, the transcription factor T-box 21 (T-bet), and IL-12-induced STAT4 signaling, which can couple with IL-18-induced IRAK and NF-kappaB transcription factors to drive the high amounts of IFN-gamma required to eradicate intracellular pathogens (Glimcher and Murphy, 2000).

('STAT3', 'Gene_expression', 'RORgammat')

Whereas high doses of antigen, with sustained TCR signaling and extracellular-signal regulated (ERK) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation, result in Th1 cells producing IFN-gamma via an IL-12-independent mechanism, low doses of antigen, with transient ERK1 and ERK2 activation, favor Th2 responses and IL-4 secretion (Constant et al., 1995; Hosken et al., 1995; Jorritsma et al., 2003; Yamane et al., 2005).
('ERK2', 'Localization', 'IL-4'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('ERK1', 'Localization', 'IL-4')

Here, we showed that in vitro differentiation of IL-10-producing Th1 cells from naive CD4+ T cells required IL-12-induced STAT4 signaling, strong TCR activation (high antigen dose), and sustained ERK1 and ERK2 phosphorylation.
('ERK1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('ERK2', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Furthermore, we showed that activation of ERK1 and ERK2 is a requirement for production of IL-10 by Th1, Th2, and Th17 cell subsets.

The cytokines IFN-beta, IFN-gamma, IL-4, and LPS, although unable to induce sialoadhesin expression by themselves, were able to enhance GC-mediated induction of sialoadhesin.

Comparison of the different combinations of GC and cytokines/LPS revealed differences in the level of GC-dependent enhancement of sialoadhesin expression, with IFN-beta and IL-4 being more potent than IFN-gamma and LPS.

This study demonstrates that GC act as a primary inducer of sialoadhesin expression on rat macrophages, and that the response can be enhanced by IFN-beta, T cell-derived cytokines, or LPS.

It is generally accepted that Bcl-2 exerts its antiapoptotic effects mainly by dimerizing with proapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family such as Bax and Bad.
('Bcl-2', 'Binding', 'Bcl-2')

We have found that Bcl-2 overexpression leads to the prevention of chemotherapy (paclitaxel)-induced expression of FasL and blocks paclitaxel-induced apoptosis.
('Bcl-2', 'Gene_expression', 'FasL')

Furthermore, Bcl-2 antagonizes drug-induced apoptosis by inhibiting calcineurin activation, blocking NFAT nuclear translocation, and preventing FasL expression.
('Bcl-2', 'Gene_expression', 'FasL')

The effects of Bcl-2 can be overcome, at least partially, through phosphorylation of Bcl-2.
('Bcl-2', 'Binding', 'Bcl-2')

Phosphorylated Bcl-2 cannot bind calcineurin, and NFAT activation, FasL expression, and apoptosis can occur after Bcl-2 phosphorylation.

To understand the role of NF-kappa B complexes in T cell development and activation, we have generated transgenic mice in which RelA and c-Rel complexes were selectively inhibited in the T-lineage cells by specific expression of a trans-dominant form of I kappa B alpha.

IkappaBalpha degradation and RPS3 nuclear translocation
('IkappaBalpha', 'Binding', 'RPS3'),('IkappaBalpha', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

Since IkappaBalpha degradation is a prerequisite to unmask the NLS of p65, and both RPS3 and IkappaBalpha bind to p65 in the cytoplasmic inhibitory complex, we tested whether IkappaBalpha degradation is required for the liberation of RPS3.
('IkappaBalpha', 'Binding', 'RPS3'),('IkappaBalpha', 'Localization', 'RPS3'),('IkappaBalpha', 'Regulation', 'p65'),('RPS3', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

We measured the association of RPS3 with importin-alpha in 293T cells overexpressing wild-type IkappaBalpha or an IkappaBalpha mutant (SSAA) resistant to IKKbeta-induced phosphorylation and degradation.
('IkappaBalpha', 'Binding', 'RPS3'),('IkappaBalpha', 'Localization', 'RPS3'),('IKKbeta', 'Phosphorylation', 'IkappaBalpha'),('IKKbeta', 'Protein_catabolism', 'IkappaBalpha')

In cells transfected with wild-type IkappaBalpha, TNF stimulation augmented the interaction of RPS3 and importin-alpha to a similar degree as in non-transfected cells.
('IkappaBalpha', 'Binding', 'RPS3'),('IkappaBalpha', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

By contrast, we observed that the RPS3-importin-alpha association was abolished by the presence of non-degradable IkappaBalpha (Fig.
('IkappaBalpha', 'Binding', 'RPS3'),('IkappaBalpha', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

To examine whether IkappaBalpha is the only cytoplasmic barrier precluding RPS3 nuclear translocation, we measured both RPS3-importin-alpha association and nuclear RPS3 after reducing IkappaBalpha expression.
('IkappaBalpha', 'Binding', 'RPS3'),('IkappaBalpha', 'Localization', 'RPS3'),('RPS3', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

Moreover, cells treated with sodium pervanadate (Pv) to induce IkappaBalpha degradation through an IKK-independent mechanism25-27 did not show increased association between RPS3 and importin-alpha (Fig.
('IkappaBalpha', 'Binding', 'RPS3'),('IkappaBalpha', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

3b) or nuclear accumulation of RPS3, despite complete IkappaBalpha degradation (Supplementary Fig.
('IkappaBalpha', 'Binding', 'RPS3'),('IkappaBalpha', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

We further examined whether a subsequent NF-kappaB activation signal independently promotes the importin-alpha association and nuclear transport of RPS3 after IkappaBalpha degradation.
('IkappaBalpha', 'Binding', 'RPS3'),('IkappaBalpha', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

Thus, IkappaBalpha phosphorylation and degradation itself is required but not sufficient to cause RPS3 association with importin-alpha followed by nuclear translocation.

BMP-6 induces phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8
('BMP-6', 'Phosphorylation', 'Smad1'),('BMP-6', 'Phosphorylation', '5'),('BMP-6', 'Phosphorylation', '8')

Interestingly, treatment with 500 ng/ml BMP-6 induced phosphorylation of Smad.
('BMP-6', 'Phosphorylation', '5')

The BMP-6 induced phosphorylation was high at the earliest time point tested (15 minutes), and remained high for at least 48 hours (Figure 5).
('BMP-6', 'Phosphorylation', '5'),('BMP-6', 'Phosphorylation', '8')

However, we did not observe any significant changes in the level of phospho-STAT3 or phospho-p38 upon BMP-6 treatment of B cells (data not shown).

Although Foxp3 could down-regulate Tax-dependent transactivation of the HTLV-I LTR (Figure 4B) and inhibit Tax expression from an infectious molecular clone (Figure 5), Foxp3 failed to modulate Tax function in the absence of the viral promoter (Figure 4D).
('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

Therefore, we hypothesized that Foxp3 may inhibit Tax transactivation of the HTLV-I LTR via disruption of the CREB signaling pathway.
('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

To test this possibility, HEK 293T cells were transfected with an HTLV-I LTR or synthetic CREB reporter vector along with a control expression vector (EGFP) or expression vectors encoding Foxp3 or deltaFKH.
('deltaFKH', 'Positive_regulation', 'CREB')

Like NF-kappaB activation, CREB transcriptional activation was also suppressed by expression of Foxp3, and to a similar extent deltaFKH, in healthy donor CD4+ T cells (Figure 6B).
('deltaFKH', 'Positive_regulation', 'CREB')

As observed with NF-kappaB activation, deltaFKH was a more potent inhibitor of CREB activation in CD4+ T cells than in HEK 293T cells, further indicating that a cell type-specific mechanism of action may govern the function of this Foxp3 mutant.
('deltaFKH', 'Positive_regulation', 'CREB')

However, Foxp3 failed to markedly affect transcriptional activation of Gal4-BD-c-Jun (c-Jun has also been demonstrated to bind to the HTLV-I LTR) and Gal4-BD-Tax (see Figure 5).

Interleukin-10 Production by Th1 Cells Requires Interleukin-12-Induced STAT4 Transcription Factor and ERK MAP Kinase Activation by High Antigen Dose
('ERK', 'Gene_expression', 'Interleukin-10'),('STAT4', 'Gene_expression', 'Interleukin-10')

We showed that development of IL-10-producing Th1 cells required high T cell receptor (TCR) ligation, sustained ERK1 and ERK2 MAP kinases phosphorylation, and IL-12-induced STAT4 transcription factor activation.
('ERK2', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'STAT4'),('ERK1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Although Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells require the activation of distinct STATs for their differentiation, activation of ERK1 and ERK2 was a common requirement for production of IL-10 by all Th cell subsets.

CD30-dependent degradation of TRAF2: implications for negative regulation of TRAF signaling and the control of cell survival.
('CD30', 'Protein_catabolism', 'TRAF2')

During CD30 signal transduction, we found that binding of TRAF2 to the cytoplasmic domain of CD30 results in the rapid depletion of TRAF2 and the associated protein TRAF1 by proteolysis.
('CD30', 'Protein_catabolism', 'TRAF2'),('TRAF2', 'Protein_catabolism', 'TRAF2')

These data suggest a model in which CD30 limits its own ability to transduce cell survival signals through signal-coupled depletion of TRAF2.

Nonpituitary human prolactin gene transcription is independent of Pit-1 and differentially controlled in lymphocytes and in endometrial stroma.
('Pit-1', 'Transcription', 'prolactin')

In order to delineate the tissue-specific mechanisms governing the control of nonpituitary PRL gene expression, we have cloned and sequenced 3 kb 5'-flanking DNA of the upstream decidual/lymphoid (dPRL) promoter.
('PR', 'Regulation', 'dPRL')

We focused our studies on the role of Pit-1 and of PR as potential transcriptional regulators, since the POU domain protein Pit-1 is essential in the control of pituitary PRL expression, and progesterone induces decidual transformation of the endometrial stroma, a differentiation process during which the decidual PRL gene is activated.
('Pit-1', 'Gene_expression', 'PRL')

We demonstrate in a variety of cell types, including lymphocytes and endometrial stroma, that Pit-1 is not involved in the regulation of dPRL promoter/reporter gene constructs carrying 3 kb 5'-flanking DNA.
('Pit-1', 'Gene_expression', 'PRL'),('PR', 'Regulation', 'dPRL')

Our experiments also show that activated PR does not confer direct transcriptional control on the dPRL promoter.
('PR', 'Regulation', 'dPRL')

When we compared the activity of the transfected dPRL promoter in PRL-secreting and nonsecreting lymphoid cells, we found that the 3 kb 5'-flanking region of the dPRL promoter did not contain elements restricting expression to only those lymphocytes that produce PRL but allowed expression of fusion reporter genes irrespective of the status of the endogenous PRL gene.
('PR', 'Regulation', 'dPRL')

This was in sharp contrast to endometrial cells where 3 kb 5'-flanking DNA conferred strong transcriptional activation on the dPRL promoter in decidualized endometrial stromal cells actively secreting PRL, but did not allow transcription in undifferentiated non-PRL-secreting endometrial stromal cells.
('PR', 'Regulation', 'dPRL')

Activation of the dPRL promoter construct in these undifferentiated cells could however be induced by the addition of cAMP, in the absence of progesterone, suggesting that a signal transduced through the cAMP signaling pathway is a primary inducer of decidual PRL gene expression.
('PR', 'Regulation', 'dPRL')

The interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) gene is both an immediate-early G1 phase gene and an S phase gene inducible by PRL in rat Nb2 T lymphocytes.
('PRL', 'Gene_expression', 'IRF-1')

To understand the mechanism by which PRL regulates the biphasic expression of IRF-1, we cloned the rat IRF-1 gene and functionally characterized the IRF-1 promoter.
('PRL', 'Gene_expression', 'IRF-1')

Upon transfection into Nb2 T cells, 1.7 kilobases (kb) of IRF-1 5'-flanking DNA linked to a chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) reporter gene mediated a 30-fold induction of CAT enzyme activity in response to 24 h of PRL stimulation.
('PRL', 'Gene_expression', 'IRF-1')

By assaying CAT enzyme activity across a 24-h PRL induction time course, we were able to assign G1 vs. S phase PRL responses of the IRF-1 gene to different regions of the IRF-1 5'-flanking and promoter DNA.
('PRL', 'Gene_expression', 'IRF-1')

Hence, the PRL-induced biphasic expression of the IRF-1 gene appears to be controlled by separate PRL-responsive elements: elements in the first 0.2 kb of the IRF-1 promoter region act during early activation, and elements between 0.2 and 1.7 kb act in concert with the proximal 0.2-kb region during S phase progression.
('PRL', 'Gene_expression', 'IRF-1')

In this study, we show that an activation-deficient glucocorticoid receptor mutant is as effective as the wild-type receptor in repression of AP-1 activity, inhibition of interleukin-2 production, inhibition of c-myc expression and induction of apoptosis.

The 3'-CAGGTG E-box could bind USF proteins, the ubiquitous repressor ZEB, or the basic helix-loop-helix proteins E2A and HEB, and we showed that a competition between ZEB and E2A/HEB proteins is involved in the silencer activity.
('ZEB', 'Binding', 'E2A'),('ZEB', 'Binding', 'HEB')

One of the essential proteins which bound to the enhancer was similar or identical to members of the C/EBP family of transcription factors required for both IL-1- and LPS-specific induction of the IL-6 gene (i.e., the NF-IL6 proteins).
('NF-IL6', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-6')

We also tested the impact of activating NF-kappaB by overexpressing IKKbeta on RPS3 nuclear translocation.
('IKKbeta', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3')

To examine the role of S209 phosphorylation of RPS3 to its NF-kappaB function6, 7, 30, we silenced endogenous RPS3 expression using an siRNA that targets the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) of RPS3 mRNA, followed by complementation with either wild-type or S209A mutant RPS3 via transfection.
('RPS3', 'Binding', 'RPS3'),('RPS3', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

As expected, RPS3 siRNA severely reduced endogenous RPS3 abundance compared to NS siRNA, but did not affect the robust expression of Flag-tagged RPS3 from a transfected construct lacking the 3' UTR (Fig.
('RPS3', 'Binding', 'RPS3'),('RPS3 siRNA', 'Gene_expression', 'Flag-tagged RPS3'),('RPS3', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

We also found that RPS3 knockdown reduced TNF-induced expression of an Ig kappaB-driven luciferase construct6 (Fig.
('RPS3', 'Negative_regulation', 'luciferase')

The impaired luciferase signal caused by RPS3 deficiency was completely restored by transfecting wild-type, but not by S209A RPS3 (Fig.
('RPS3', 'Binding', 'RPS3'),('RPS3', 'Negative_regulation', 'luciferase'),('RPS3', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

Moreover, the failure of S209A RPS3 to restore luciferase activity did not result from defective translation because the transient overexpression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) was comparable in cells complemented with wild-type or S029A RPS3 (Supplementary Fig.
('RPS3', 'Binding', 'RPS3'),('RPS3', 'Negative_regulation', 'luciferase'),('RPS3', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

We next used chromatin immunoprecipitation to determine whether S209 phosphorylation affects RPS3 and p65 recruitment to specific kappaB sites in intact chromatin during NF-kappaB activation.
('RPS3', 'Localization', 'p65'),('RPS3', 'Binding', 'p65')

In RPS3 knockdown cells, PMA+I stimulated the recruitment of ectopically expressed, Flag-tagged wild-type, but not S209A RPS3 to the kappaB sites of the NFKBIA and IL8 promoters (Fig.
('RPS3', 'Binding', 'RPS3'),('RPS3', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

While expressing RPS3 S209A had no impact on p65 nuclear translocation, it substantially attenuated p65 recruitment (Fig.
('RPS3', 'Localization', 'p65'),('RPS3', 'Binding', 'p65')

Additional experiments revealed that p65 attraction to RPS3-independent NF-kappaB target gene promoters such as CD25 was increased (Supplementary Fig.
('RPS3', 'Localization', 'p65'),('RPS3', 'Binding', 'p65')

There was no significant Flag-RPS3 or p65 recruitment to ACTB promoter lacking kappaB sites (Fig.
('RPS3', 'Localization', 'p65'),('RPS3', 'Binding', 'p65')

Thus, the recruitment of RPS3 as well as the contingent recruitment of p65 to key promoters depended on S209.
('RPS3', 'Localization', 'p65'),('RPS3', 'Binding', 'p65')

Interleukin 8 (IL-8) secretion induced by either T cell receptor (TCR) agonist stimulation or PMA+I was decreased as a consequence of reduced RPS3/p65 recruitment to the IL8 kappaB sites in the presence of S209A mutant compared to wild-type RPS3 (Supplementary Fig.
('RPS3', 'Binding', 'RPS3'),('RPS3', 'Localization', 'p65'),('RPS3', 'Binding', 'p65'),('RPS3', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

Therefore, RPS3 S209 phosphorylation by IKKbeta is apparently required for RPS3 in directing NF-kappaB to a specific subset of target genes.

('Tax', 'Phosphorylation', 'IkappaB alpha'),('Tax', 'Protein_catabolism', 'IkappaB alpha')

Our studies now demonstrate that HTLV-1 Tax activates the recently identified cellular kinases IkappaB kinase alpha (IKKalpha) and IKKbeta, which normally phosphorylate IkappaB alpha on both of its N-terminal regulatory serines in response to tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1 (IL-1) stimulation.

The Th2 cytokine IL-4 inhibits FOXP3 expression during T cell priming.

GATA3 binds to theFOXP3promoter and can repress the FOXP3 trans-activation process directly in Th2 cells (Mantel et al., 2007).
('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

It was further demonstrated that both Th1 and Th2 transcription factors T-bet and GATA3 oppose peripheral induction of Foxp3+T reg cells in mice through STAT1-, STAT4-, and STAT6-dependent pathways (Wei et al., 2007).

They include the crucial choices between cell-cycle exit and continued proliferation, as well as between cell differentiation and self-renewal (Blyth et al., 2005).Because of the involvement of RUNX mutations in different autoimmune diseases and the known interaction with TGF-beta, we investigated the impact of RUNX1 and RUNX3 on the expression of FOXP3 and subsequently on the development and function of iT reg cells.

Transcriptional regulation of the beta-casein gene by cytokines: cross-talk between STAT5 and other signaling molecules.
('STAT5', 'Gene_expression', 'beta-casein')

The beta-casein promoter has been widely used to monitor the activation of STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription)5 since STAT5 was originally found as a mediator of PRL-inducible beta-casein expression.
('STAT5', 'Gene_expression', 'beta-casein'),('PRL', 'Gene_expression', 'beta-casein')

However, not only is expression of the beta-casein gene regulated by STAT5 but it is also affected by other molecules such as glucocorticoid and Ras.
('STAT5', 'Gene_expression', 'beta-casein')

We have found that the beta-casein gene is expressed in a cytotoxic T cell line, CTLL-2, in response to interleukin-2 (IL-2), which activates STAT5.
('STAT5', 'Gene_expression', 'beta-casein'),('IL-2', 'Gene_expression', 'beta-casein')

('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'OSM'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'CIS'),('STAT5', 'Gene_expression', 'beta-casein'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'beta-casein')

IL-2-induced beta-casein expression was enhanced by dexamethasone, and this synergistic effect of Dexamethasone requires the sequence between -155 and -193 in the beta-casein promoter.
('IL-2', 'Gene_expression', 'beta-casein')

Coincidentally, a deletion of this region enhanced the IL-2-induced expression of beta-casein.
('IL-2', 'Gene_expression', 'beta-casein')

Expression of an active form of Ras, Ras(G12V), suppressed the IL-2-induced beta-casein and OSM gene expression, and the negative effect of Ras is mediated by the region between -105 and -193 in the beta-casein promoter.
('Ras(G12V)', 'Positive_regulation', 'beta-casein'),('IL-2', 'Gene_expression', 'OSM'),('IL-2', 'Gene_expression', 'beta-casein')

In apparent contradiction, expression of a dominant negative form of Ras, RasN17, also inhibited IL-2-induced activation of the promoter containing the minimal beta-casein STAT5 element as well as the promoters of CIS and OSM.
('RasN17', 'Positive_regulation', 'CIS'),('RasN17', 'Positive_regulation', 'OSM'),('IL-2', 'Gene_expression', 'OSM'),('STAT5', 'Gene_expression', 'beta-casein'),('IL-2', 'Gene_expression', 'beta-casein')

In addition, Ras(G12V) complemented signaling by an erythropoietin receptor mutant defective in Ras activation and augmented the activation of the beta-casein promoter by the mutant erythropoietin receptor signaling, suggesting a possible role of Ras in Stat5-mediated gene expression.
('erythropoietin receptor', 'Positive_regulation', 'beta-casein'),('Ras(G12V)', 'Positive_regulation', 'beta-casein')

We now demonstrate that B7, but not LFA-3, strongly costimulated IL-2 transcription and mRNA expression in CD4+ T cells.
('B7', 'Transcription', 'IL-2'),('LFA-3', 'Transcription', 'IL-2')

These may partly account for the differential effects of B7 and LFA-3 costimulation on IL-2 expression.

In this report, we demonstrate that one of the functions of CIITA is to recruit the CREB binding protein (CBP) to class II promoters.
('CIITA', 'Binding', 'CBP')

Not only functional but also specific binding interactions between CIITA and CBP were demonstrated.
('CIITA', 'Binding', 'CBP')

The functional interaction between Foxp3 and CREB did not affect the DNA-binding activity of CREB-1, but did show a modest decrease in activating transcription factor 2 (ATF-2) DNA-binding activity in the presence of forskolin as determined by transcription factor ELISA (Figure 7B).
('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'activating transcription factor 2'),('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'CREB-1')

To determine whether Foxp3 can disrupt the function/recruitment of the coactivator protein p300, we introduced a Gal4 reporter vector and a Gal4-BD-CREB-1 expression vector into HEK 293T cells in the absence or presence of Foxp3, p300, and/or control expression vectors (Figure 7C).
('p300', 'Transcription', 'Gal4-BD-CREB-1'),('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'CREB-1'),('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'p300'),('p300', 'Binding', 'p300'),('Foxp3', 'Positive_regulation', 'Gal4-BD-CREB-1')

As expected, p300 overexpression stimulated transcription of the Gal4-BD-CREB-1 fusion protein.
('p300', 'Transcription', 'Gal4-BD-CREB-1')

Foxp3, again, repressed basal levels of Gal4-BD-CREB-1 activation by more than 2-fold, while effectively neutralizing Gal4-BD-CREB-1 activation in the presence of p300.
('p300', 'Transcription', 'Gal4-BD-CREB-1'),('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'CREB-1'),('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'p300'),('Foxp3', 'Positive_regulation', 'Gal4-BD-CREB-1')

Overexpression of Foxp3 failed to reduce the detectable levels of CREB phosphorylation using a phosphospecific antibody for CREB-1 (unpublished data).
('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'CREB-1')

However, when we attempted to determine whether Foxp3 could physically interact with the coactivator protein p300, we found that p300 immunoprecipitated Foxp3 when both proteins were overexpressed in HEK 293T cells (Figure 7D).
('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'p300'),('p300', 'Binding', 'p300')

Collectively, these results suggest that Foxp3 antagonizes CREB-dependent gene expression by directly interacting with coactivator p300 and interfering with its function and/or recruitment to CREB-responsive promoter sequences.
('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'p300')

To explore the mechanism by which NleH1 inhibits RPS3 S209 phosphorylation, we first performed an in vitro kinase assay with purified wild-type His-NleH1 protein and a mutant His-NleH1 (K159A) protein, confirming that NleH1 is autophosphorylated and the K159A is an NleH1 kinase-dead mutant (Fig.
('NleH1', 'Phosphorylation', 'NleH1'),('NleH1', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('NleH1', 'Localization', 'RPS3'),('NleH', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('NleH', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

To examine whether the kinase activity is required for NleH1 to inhibit IKKbeta phosphorlyation of RPS3 on S209, we ectopically expressing either wild-type or K159A NleH1 in 293T cells.
('NleH1', 'Phosphorylation', 'NleH1'),('IKKbeta', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('NleH1', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('NleH1', 'Localization', 'RPS3'),('NleH', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('IKKbeta', 'Localization', 'RPS3'),('NleH', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

Wild-type NleH1 expression significantly reduced TNF-induced RPS3 S209 phosphorylation, whereas the K159A mutant failed to do so (Fig.
('TNF', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('NleH1', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('NleH1', 'Localization', 'RPS3'),('NleH', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('NleH', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

Thus NleH1 kinase activity is required to protect RPS3 from IKKbeta-mediated phosphorylation.

Citrobacter rodentium is a mouse pathogen that shares pathogenic strategies with E. coli 39, most notably for our investigation, C. rodentium NleH inhibited RPS3 nuclear translocation and RPS3-dependent NF-kappaB luciferase activity to an extent equivalent to E. coli NleH1 (ref.
('RPS3', 'Positive_regulation', 'luciferase'),('NleH1', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('NleH1', 'Localization', 'RPS3'),('NleH', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('NleH', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

In uninfected cells, TNF-treatment stimulated a ~3.5-fold increase in RPS3 S209 phosphorylation (Fig.
('TNF', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3')

However, RPS3 phosphorylation was enhanced when cells were infected with a C. rodentium strain lacking NleH (Fig.
('NleH', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('NleH', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

We further examined the role of NleH1 kinase activity using the C. rodentium deltanleH strain as a background on which to express either wild-type or K159A E. coli NleH1.
('NleH1', 'Phosphorylation', 'NleH1')

Complementing deltanleH mutant with wild-type NleH1 almost abolished TNF-induced RPS3 S209 phosphorylation whereas complementing with K159A failed to inhibit RPS3 phosphorylation (Fig.
('TNF', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('NleH1', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('NleH1', 'Localization', 'RPS3'),('NleH', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('NleH', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

('NleH1', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('NleH1', 'Localization', 'RPS3'),('NleH', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('NleH', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

We next examined whether the inhibitory activity of NleH1 is sufficiently robust to impair the strong nuclear translocation of RPS3 trigged by the constitutively-active IKKbeta (IKKbeta [SSEE]) (Fig.
('IKKbeta', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('NleH1', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('NleH1', 'Localization', 'RPS3'),('NleH', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('IKKbeta', 'Localization', 'RPS3'),('NleH', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

We found that ectopically expressing either wild-type or SSEE IKKbeta proteins, triggered more RPS3 nuclear translocation than the kinase-dead IKKbeta (SSAA) protein (Fig.
('SSEE IKKbeta', 'Localization', 'RPS3'),('IKKbeta', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('IKKbeta', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

In contrast, infecting with either deltanleH1 or deltaescN strains only slightly impaired RPS3 nuclear translocation in either IKKbeta- or IKKbeta (SSEE)-expressing cells (Fig.
('IKKbeta', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('IKKbeta', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

As expected, E. coli infections did not affect the RPS3 nuclear translocation in IKKbeta (SSAA)-expressing cells, where NF-kappaB signaling was low (Fig.
('IKKbeta', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('IKKbeta', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

Thus, during infection NleH1 is sufficiently potent to inhibit RPS3 nuclear translocation even in cells expressing constitutively-activated IKKbeta.
('IKKbeta', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('NleH1', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('NleH1', 'Localization', 'RPS3'),('NleH', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('IKKbeta', 'Localization', 'RPS3'),('NleH', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

We examined whether NleH1 could directly phosphorylate IKKbeta thus inhibiting IKKbeta-mediated RPS3 S209 phosphorylation.
('IKKbeta', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('NleH1', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('NleH1', 'Localization', 'RPS3'),('NleH', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('IKKbeta', 'Localization', 'RPS3'),('NleH', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

We performed in vitro kinase assays using immunoprecipitated Flag-IKKbeta (K44A) as substrate and recombinant His-NleH1 as kinase, so that IKKbeta autophosphorylation would not obscure NleH1-induced phosphorylation.
('NleH1', 'Phosphorylation', 'NleH1')

As expected, IKKbeta phosphorylated RPS3 (Fig.
('IKKbeta', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('IKKbeta', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

Preincubation of IKKbeta with NleH1 reduced IKKbeta-mediated RPS3 phosphorylation, i.e.
('IKKbeta', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('NleH1', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('NleH1', 'Localization', 'RPS3'),('NleH', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('IKKbeta', 'Localization', 'RPS3'),('NleH', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

the CK2 kinase specificity, but not IKKbeta-mediated GST-IkappaBalpha phosphorylation, i.e.
('IKKbeta', 'Phosphorylation', 'GST-IkappaBalpha')

Control experiments revealed no NleH1-mediated phosphorylation or autophosphorylation of RPS3 or GST-IkappaBalpha (Fig.
('NleH1', 'Phosphorylation', 'GST-IkappaBalpha'),('NleH1', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('NleH1', 'Localization', 'RPS3'),('NleH', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('NleH', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

Taken together, NleH1 blocks the CK2 substrate specificity of IKKbeta thus inhibiting the IKKbeta-mediated RPS3 S209 phosphorylation thus representing a novel strategy by E. coli O157:H7 to alter the host innate immune response.
('IKKbeta', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('NleH1', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('NleH1', 'Localization', 'RPS3'),('NleH', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('IKKbeta', 'Localization', 'RPS3'),('NleH', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

BMP-6 can signal through the ligation of the type I receptors Act-RIA, BMP-RIA, and BMP-RIB and the type II receptors BMP-RII, Act-RIIA and Act-RIIB, which lead to the phosphorylation of the receptor Smads (Smad-1, Smad-5, and Smad-8).
('BMP-6', 'Phosphorylation', 'Smad-1'),('BMP-6', 'Phosphorylation', 'Smad-8'),('BMP-6', 'Phosphorylation', 'Smad-5')

Furthermore, the expression of BMP receptors and BMP-6 induced activation of the Smad signalling pathway with subsequent regulation of the target genes Id1-Id4, were resolved.
('BMP-6', 'Regulation', 'Id4'),('BMP-6', 'Regulation', 'Id1')

The cell cycle-dependent transcription factor, E2F-1, regulates the cyclin-like species of the DNA repair enzyme uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG) gene in human osteosarcoma (Saos-2) cells.
('E2F-1', 'Positive_regulation', 'UDG')

We demonstrate, through the deletion of the human UDG promoter sequences, that expression of E2F-1 activates the UDG promoter through several E2F sites.
('E2F-1', 'Positive_regulation', 'UDG')

Here, we showed that Th1 cells required high-antigen-dose-induced ERK1 and ERK2 phosphorylation and IL-12-induced STAT-4 activation to produce IL-10.
('ERK1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('ERK', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'STAT-4'),('STAT-4', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('ERK2', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Our findings that ERK1 and ERK2 activation was a common pathway required for the production of IL-10 by Th1, Th2, and Th17 cell subsets, which differentiate along distinct pathways, such that IL-10 provides a highly regulated feedback loop to avoid the extremes of excessive inflammation or chronic infections and also allow a protective response to diverse pathogens.
('ERK1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('ERK', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('IL-10', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('ERK2', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Under these conditions, we speculate that Th1 cells will be induced to express high amounts of IL-10, in keeping with reports that IL-10-producing Th1 cells were found in CD4+ clones isolated from BAL but not blood of TB patients (Gerosa et al., 1999).
('IL-10', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Similarly, the immune response to a clinical isolate of L. major, which produces heavily infected nonhealing lesions, was found to be regulated by IL-10 derived from Foxp3- Th1 cells that coproduce IL-10 and IFN-gamma (Anderson et al., 2007), and the immune response during T. gondii infection was found also to be regulated by Foxp3- Th1 cells (Jankovic et al., 2007).
('IL-10', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IFN-gamma', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10')

It is likely that IL-10 production by Th1 cells is evoked under conditions of high inflammation and antigenic stimulation, whereas regulatory CD4+ T cells producing IL-10 may operate to regulate the immune response under conditions in which the pathogen is clinically controlled, such as in infection with L. major (Friedlin strain) (Belkaid et al., 2002; Suffia et al., 2006).
('IL-10', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

We now also reported that CD4+ T cells cultured with high antigen dose and IL-12 differentiate into canonical Th1 effector cells, which, in addition to expressing large amounts of IFN-gamma and IL-10, lose their IL-2 expression as described before in certain chronic infection models (Sallusto et al., 2004).
('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('IFN-gamma', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

We showed here that this induction of IL-10 in Th1 cells in vivo was markedly, but not totally, reduced in STAT4-deficient T cells as observed during T. gondii infection (Jankovic et al., 2002).
('STAT4', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10')

A high antigenic activation during T. gondii infection or high antigen doses delivered in the presence of LPS, as seen in our system, may compensate for an absolute requirement for IL-12 in the induction of IL-10 by Th1 cells.
('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

In our in vitro system, repeated stimulation of Th1 cells with high antigen doses allowed the development of Th1 cells producing IL-10 in an IL-12-dependent manner.
('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

IL-10 production by Th1 cells induced by high antigen dose and IL-12 was independent of IFN-gamma, in keeping with previous findings (Jankovic et al., 2002).
('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('IFN-gamma', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

However, a role for IFN-gamma in mediating IL-10 reactivation by Th1 cells during secondary infection with T. gondii has been suggested (Shaw et al., 2006).
('IFN-gamma', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10')

We have found that CD4+ T cells exposed to a high dose of antigen do not express IL-10 upon restimulation, but can be induced to produce IL-10 upon re-exposure to a high dose of antigen in the recall phase in the absence of added IL-12.
('IL-10', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

The combination of both high antigen dose and IL-12 resulted in the highest levels of IL-10 production and correlated with the high levels of ERK1 and ERK2 activation.
('ERK1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('ERK', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('ERK2', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

It is thus likely that in T. gondii infection in vivo (Shaw et al., 2006), the requirement for IFN-gamma to induce IL-10, was for feedback upregulation of IL-12 by DCs, which in turn induced IL-10 in the Th1 cells.
('IL-10', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('IFN-gamma', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Costimulatory OX-40 signals have been shown to negatively regulate IL-10 production (Ito et al., 2005) both in Th1 and Th2 cells, whereas ICOS signaling has been suggested to induce IL-10 (Ito et al., 2007; Witsch et al., 2002) in both Th1 and Th2 cells.
('IL-10', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

We now provide a common mechanism of ERK1 and ERK2 activation for the regulation of IL-10 production in Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells, although each subset differentiates along a distinct and subset-specific transcriptional pathway.
('ERK1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('ERK', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('ERK2', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Of note, a role for ERK1 and ERK2 activation in the induction of IL-10 production has already been described for macrophages and DC (Agrawal et al., 2006; Hacker et al., 1999).
('ERK1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('ERK', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('ERK2', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Differential transcriptional regulation of IL-10 in Th1 and Th2 cells has been suggested (Chang et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2005), and extensive histone acetylation of the IL-10 gene is detectable in fully polarized Th2 cells, but not Th1 cells (Chang et al., 2007).
('IL-10', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

We provide evidence that IL-10 is produced in canonical Th1 cells and that its expression correlates with the expression of T-bet and the highest IFN-gamma production, in keeping with our observations that high-dose antigen stimulation and IL-12 signaling are required for IL-10 and IFN-gamma expression.
('IL-10', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('IFN-gamma', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

It has also been shown that maintenance of IL-10 expression is conditional on IL-12 or IL-4 unless the IL-10 gene is imprinted by GATA-3 (Chang et al., 2007), which can remodel the IL-10 locus, thus explaining the highest amounts of IL-10 produced by Th2 cells (Chang et al., 2007; Shoemaker et al., 2006).
('IL-10', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

We show here that high antigen dose and IL-12 drastically downregulate Gata-3 expression, suggesting that additional factors are in place to induce IL-10 expression in Th1 cells, albeit transiently.
('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'Gata-3'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Expression of c-maf was greatly diminished by high antigen doses in T cells and yet was unexpectedly maintained by IL-12 and present in Th17 cells.
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'c-maf')

That c-maf expression is common to IL-10-producing Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells and, like IL-10, is dependent on ERK activation in Th1 and Th17 cells for its expression is of interest because c-Maf has been shown to be an essential transcription factor for IL-10 expression in macrophages (Cao et al., 2005).
('ERK', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('IL-10', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('ERK', 'Gene_expression', 'c-maf'),('c-Maf', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

ERK1 and ERK2 activation is required for IL-10 production by all these Th cell subsets.
('ERK1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('ERK', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('ERK2', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

With regard to the expression of IL-10 by Th1 cells, our data provide a mechanism for how IL-10 expression is induced and then amplified and regulated by the levels of antigen and IL-12 encountered in the environment.
('IL-10', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Increased expression of wild-type NFAT1 substantially increases IL-4 promoter activity in unprimed CD4 T cells, suggesting NFAT1 may be limiting for IL-4 gene expression in this cell type.
('NFAT1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-4'),('NFAT1', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-4'),('IL-4', 'Binding', 'IL-4')

Furthermore, a truncated form of NFAT1 acts as a dominant-negative, reducing IL-4 promoter activity in primed CD4 T cells and confirming the importance of endogenous NFAT to increased IL-4 gene expression by effector T cells.
('NFAT1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-4'),('NFAT1', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-4'),('IL-4', 'Binding', 'IL-4')

NFAT1 appears to be the major NFAT family member responsible for the initial increased expression of IL-4 by primed CD4 T cells.

The role of RUNX1 and RUNX3 transcription factors in TGF-beta-mediated iT reg cell generation
('TGF-beta', 'Transcription', 'RUNX1'),('TGF-beta', 'Transcription', 'RUNX3')

Stimulation with anti-CD2/3/28 mAbs or TGF-beta alone resulted in a minimal up-regulation of RUNX1 and RUNX3 mRNA (Fig.
('TGF-beta', 'Transcription', 'RUNX1'),('TGF-beta', 'Transcription', 'RUNX3')

In contrast, the combination of both TGF-beta and anti-CD2/3/28 mAbs induced RUNX1 and RUNX3 mRNAs, as well as FOXP3 mRNA, within 48 h in naive CD4+ T cells.
('RUNX3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Transcription', 'RUNX1'),('RUNX', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Transcription', 'RUNX3'),('RUNX1', 'Transcription', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX3', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX3', 'Transcription', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Transcription', 'FOXP3')

Deficiency of RUNX1 or RUNX3 resulted in markedly reduced TGF-beta-mediated induction of FOXP3 mRNA in naive CD4+ T cells compared with control cells transfected with scrambled siRNA.
('RUNX3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Transcription', 'RUNX1'),('RUNX', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Transcription', 'RUNX3'),('RUNX1', 'Transcription', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX3', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX3', 'Transcription', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Transcription', 'FOXP3')

The level of FOXP3 mRNA was further reduced when both RUNX1 and RUNX3 were knocked down in naive CD4+ T cells during their differentiation to iT reg cells (Fig.
('RUNX3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Transcription', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX3', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX3', 'Transcription', 'FOXP3')

We observed no change in GATA3 expression in Th2 cells, T-bet expression in Th1 cells, or RORC2 mRNA expression in Th17 cells in which RUNX1 and RUNX3 were knocked down compared with control cells.
('RUNX1', 'Transcription', 'T-bet'),('RUNX3', 'Transcription', 'GATA3'),('RUNX1', 'Transcription', 'GATA3'),('RUNX1', 'Transcription', 'RORC2'),('RUNX3', 'Transcription', 'T-bet'),('RUNX3', 'Transcription', 'RORC2')

On the contrary, FOXP3 mRNA was significantly decreased in RUNX1- and RUNX3-deficient T reg cells compared with control cells (Fig.
('RUNX3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Transcription', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX3', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX3', 'Transcription', 'FOXP3')

The effect of RUNX silencing on the expression level of intracellular FOXP3 during naive CD4+ T cell differentiation to iT reg was evaluated by flow cytometry.
('RUNX', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

FOXP3 was only slightly reduced after RUNX1 silencing.
('RUNX', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Transcription', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3')

The most striking FOXP3 reduction was observed when RUNX1 and RUNX3 were silenced together (Fig.
('RUNX3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Transcription', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX3', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX3', 'Transcription', 'FOXP3')

The increased impact of combined RUNX1 and RUNX3 knockdown implies that RUNX1 and RUNX3 might have redundant functions in the induction of FOXP3.
('RUNX3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Transcription', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX3', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX3', 'Transcription', 'FOXP3')

In addition, the levels of IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-13, and IFN-gamma in control siRNA-transfected or RUNX1 and RUNX3 siRNA-transfected CD4+ T cells that were cultured with or without anti-CD2/3/28 mAb and TGF-beta did not show any significant difference (Fig.
('RUNX1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-13'),('RUNX3', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('RUNX3', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('RUNX3', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-5'),('RUNX3', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-4'),('RUNX1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-5'),('RUNX1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-4'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-4'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-13'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-5'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('RUNX1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('TGF-beta', 'Transcription', 'RUNX1'),('TGF-beta', 'Transcription', 'RUNX3'),('RUNX1', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('RUNX3', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-13')

As expected, IL-10, TGF-beta, and FOXP3 mRNAs are also expressed in circulating T reg cells (Fig.
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('TGF-beta', 'Transcription', 'FOXP3')

Staining of tonsil sections for FOXP3 and RUNX3 demonstrated in vivo coexpression of these two molecules in a subset of T reg cells, whereas there was low RUNX1 expression in all tonsil cells (Fig.
('RUNX3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Transcription', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX3', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX3', 'Transcription', 'FOXP3')

Studies included structural comparison of the promoters for human and mouse inducible NO synthase (iNOS) genes, transfection and assay of human and mouse iNOS promoter regions in response to LPS +/- IFN-gamma, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays of kappa B response elements.
('IFN-gamma', 'Gene_expression', 'iNOS')

Two explanations for hyporesponsiveness of the human iNOS promoter to LPS +/- IFN-gamma were found: (1) multiple inactivating nucleotide substitutions in the human counterpart of the enhancer element that has been shown to regulate LPS/IFN-gamma induced expression of the mouse iNOS gene; and (2) and absence of one or more nuclear factors in human macrophages (e.g., an LPS-inducible nuclear factor-kappa B/Rel complex), that is (are) required for maximal expression of the gene.
('IFN-gamma', 'Gene_expression', 'iNOS')

Finally, comparison of the percent Foxp3+CD4+CD25+ T cells to the HTLV-I proviral load in HTLV-I-infected asymptomatic carriers and patients with HTLV-I-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis suggested that high Foxp3 expression is associated with low proviral load and absence of disease.
('Foxp3', 'Localization', 'Foxp3'),('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'Foxp3')

In the present study, analysis of the interleukin-2 (IL-2) gene activation shows that naive human helper T cells (cord blood CD4+ T cells, adult CD4+CD45RO- T cells) regulate IL-2 transcription by a mechanism involving both a silencer and an activator acting on the purine-rich IL-2 promoter elements (NF-AT binding sites).
('IL-2', 'Transcription', 'IL-2')

The small heat shock protein HSP27 has recently been proposed as a PKD1 substrate [24] and we accordingly assessed whether PKD-null DT40 cells have defective phosphorylation of HSP27 on serine 82, the proposed PKD1 substrate sequence.
('PKD1', 'Phosphorylation', 'HSP27')

We initially investigated the regulation of HSP27 phosphorylation in single knockout DT40 B cells lacking either PKD1 or PKD3.
('PKD1', 'Phosphorylation', 'HSP27'),('PKD3', 'Phosphorylation', 'HSP27')

BCR and phorbol ester signals were also able to increase HSP27 phosphorylation in PKD1 or PKD3 single knockout DT40 B cells (Fig.
('PKD1', 'Phosphorylation', 'HSP27'),('PKD3', 'Phosphorylation', 'HSP27')

However, BCR- and phorbol ester-induced phosphorylation of HSP27 on S82 was abolished in B cells that lacked both PKD1 and PKD3 (Fig.
('PKD1', 'Phosphorylation', 'HSP27'),('PKD3', 'Phosphorylation', 'HSP27')

Significantly, doxycycline-induced expression of the Flag-PKD3 transgene in the double knockout cells was sufficient to restore normal regulation of HSP27 phosphorylation (Fig.
('PKD3', 'Phosphorylation', 'HSP27')

In contrast, expression of a kinase-deficient PKD3 mutant protein in the double knockout cells was not able to restore BCR- or phorbol ester-induced HSP27 phosphorylation (Fig.
('PKD3', 'Phosphorylation', 'HSP27')

Hence, PKD3 as well as PKD1 can regulate HSP27 phosphorylation and in DT40 B cells they are functionally redundant as HSP27 kinases.

IL-7 reconstitutes multiple aspects of v-Abl-mediated signaling.
('IL-7', 'Positive_regulation', 'v-Abl')

Previous studies have shown constitutive activation of IL-4 and IL-7 signaling pathways, as measured by activation of Janus protein kinase (JAK)1, JAK3, STAT5, and STAT6, in pre-B cells transformed by v-Abl.
('IL-7', 'Positive_regulation', 'v-Abl')

To determine whether activation of these cytokine signaling pathways by v-Abl is important in the cellular events induced by the Abelson murine leukemia virus, the effects of IL-4 and IL-7 on pre-B cells transformed with a temperature-sensitive v-Abl mutant were examined.
('IL-7', 'Positive_regulation', 'v-Abl')

Whereas IL-4 had little or no effect, IL-7 delayed both the apoptosis and cell cycle arrest that occur upon v-Abl kinase inactivation.
('IL-7', 'Positive_regulation', 'v-Abl')

IL-7 also delayed the decreases in the levels of c-Myc, Bcl-2, and Bcl-xL that occur upon loss of v-Abl kinase activity.
('IL-7', 'Negative_regulation', 'Bcl-2'),('IL-7', 'Negative_regulation', 'c-Myc'),('IL-7', 'Negative_regulation', 'Bcl-xL'),('IL-7', 'Positive_regulation', 'v-Abl')

IL-7 did not maintain v-Abl-mediated differentiation arrest of the pre-B cells, as activation of NF-kappaB and RAG gene transcription was unaffected by IL-7.
('IL-7', 'Positive_regulation', 'v-Abl')

These results identify a potential role for IL-7 signaling pathways in transformation by v-Abl while demonstrating that a combination of IL-4 and IL-7 signaling cannot substitute for an active v-Abl kinase in transformed pre-B cells.
('IL-7', 'Positive_regulation', 'v-Abl')

IL-10 Production Is Maintained by High TCR Signal Strength and IL-12
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10')

We next investigated whether repeated strong TCR activation is a compensatory signal for IL-12-induced STAT4 signaling in the induction of IL-10 in Th1 cells.
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10')

High antigen dose and IL-12 cooperated to induce maximal IL-10 production (Figures 4A and 4B), given that this combination resulted in the highest numbers of IL-10-producing Th1 cells.
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10')

Repeated high antigen dose stimulation in the absence of exogenously added IL-12 resulted in the production of IL-10 by Th1 cells, suggesting that repeated strong TCR triggering may overcome the need for IL-12 for IL-10 induction (Figures 4C and 4D).
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10')

However, IL-10 induction under these conditions was abrogated when IL-12p40-deficient DCs were used as APCs (Figure4E).
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12p40', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10')

Thus, IL-12 is essential during both primary and secondary antigenic stimulation for production of IL-10 by Th1 cells.
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10')

To determine the requirements for stability of the IL-10-producing Th1 cells, we differentiated CD4+ Tcells for 1 week with high antigen doses with or without IL-12 (Figures 4A and 4C), washed them, and then restimulated them for an additional week with a low antigen dose, in the absence or presence of IL-12 (Figure4F).
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10')

Th1 cells induced in the first week to produce IL-10 by culture with high antigen doses and IL-12 lost their ability to express IL-10 when recultured with low doses of OVA, which could be compensated for, to some extent, by addition of IL-12 to the secondary cultures (Figure4F), again suggesting that antigen dose and IL-12 signals cooperate for the induction of IL-10.
('OVA', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10')

Finally, DO11.10 CD4+ cells that were exposed to low doses of antigen and IL-12 during the primary differentiation phase produced high amounts of IFN-gamma but little IL-10, but they could be induced to produce IL-10 when both high antigen dose and IL-12 were present during the recall phase (FigureS4).
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10')

Thus, high antigen dose and IL-12 are required for sustaining the induction of IL-10 production by Th1 cells.
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10')

The T-box transcription factors T-bet and Eomes have been linked to the regulation of genes encoding effector cytokines (e.g., Ifng) and genes important for cytolytic function (e.g., Prf1 and GzmB) (20).
('Eomes', 'Regulation', 'Prf1'),('Eomes', 'Regulation', 'Ifng'),('Eomes', 'Regulation', 'GzmB'),('T-bet', 'Regulation', 'GzmB'),('T-bet', 'Regulation', 'Prf1'),('T-bet', 'Regulation', 'Ifng')

T-bet mRNA expression slightly preceded the expression of GzmB mRNA; similarly, Eomes mRNA and protein were expressed ~1 d ahead of the reexpression of perforin mRNA and protein, respectively (Fig.
('Eomes', 'Regulation', 'GzmB'),('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('T-bet', 'Regulation', 'GzmB')

T-bet is required early for IFN-gamma production, and our data suggested that Eomes might not function during this early period but rather might contribute later to the control of perforin expression.
('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma')

Our data seemed most consistent with a model in which TCR signals induce T-bet, which in turn induces IFN-gamma (17) and possibly granzyme B; subsequently, Eomes is induced during the period of clonal expansion in IL-2 and activates perforin expression.
('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma')

Fusion of subdomains of BOB.1/OBF.1 with the GAL4 DNA binding domain reveals that both NH2- and COOH-terminal domains of BOB.1/OBF.1 contribute to full transactivation function, the COOH-terminal domain is more efficient in this transactivation assay.
('BOB.1', 'Binding', 'BOB.1')

The CD4+CD25-, CD45RA+, CD45RO+, and CD4+CD45RO+CD25- were able to significantly induce FOXP3 mRNA up to 30-fold upon TCR activation and addition of TGF-beta.
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

Th2 cells are known to produce IL-4 upon activation, which may interact with TGF-beta signaling and thus prevent FOXP3 induction.
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

However, the neutralization of IL-4 with a blocking IL-4 antibody did not rescue FOXP3 expression in the differentiated Th2 cells (unpublished data).
('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

Repeated exposure to TGF-beta did not further increase the FOXP3 expression in the iTreg lineage but transiently induced FOXP3 expression in Th1 cells.
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

Naturally occurring Th2 cells such as CRTH2+ T cells, T cells isolated according to their IL-4 secretion, or an IL-4-producing T cell clone (BR8) were also lacking FOXP3 expression (Figure 2B).
('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

Furthermore TGF-beta-mediated FOXP3 induction failed in these cells in contrast to the naive T cells (Figure 2B).
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

Because IL-4 is the key Th2 cytokine, the expression of IL-4 and FOXP3 in freshly isolated CD4+ T cells was analyzed by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS).
('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

IL-4-expressing cells were most abundant among CD45RO+CD25- cells, which did not co-express FOXP3 (Figure 3A, left panel).
('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

In contrast, CD45RO+CD25+ cells abundantly expressed FOXP3, while lacking IL-4 (Figure 3A, right panel).
('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

As shown in Figure 3B, the frequency of the IL-4+ cells was always below 1% in the FOXP3+ cells close to the background.
('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

The IL-4+ cells were confined to the FOXP3- cells, as shown for the CD45RO+CD25-, CD45RO+CD25+, and CD45RO+CD25+high cells (Figure 3B).
('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

Cells enriched for their IL-4 secretion using the magnetic cell isolation technology contained some FOXP3-expressing cells, but importantly, the expression did not overlap.
('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

We also show that mitogen induction of the interleukin-1 beta converting enzyme (ICE) gene, a mammalian homologue of the Caenorhabditis elegans cell death gene ced-3, is IRF-1-dependent.
('IRF-1', 'Positive_regulation', 'ICE')

Ectopic overexpression of IRF-1 results in the activation of the endogenous gene for ICE and enhances the sensitivity of cells to radiation-induced apoptosis.
('IRF-1', 'Positive_regulation', 'ICE')

V3-BH10 neither blocked radiolabeled IL-2 binding to IL-2 receptors nor affected tyrosyl phosphorylation of several cellular proteins (p120, p98, p96, p54, and p38), which is immediately induced by IL-2 stimulation.
('IL-2', 'Phosphorylation', 'p96'),('IL-2', 'Phosphorylation', 'p54'),('IL-2', 'Phosphorylation', 'p98'),('IL-2', 'Phosphorylation', 'p38'),('IL-2', 'Phosphorylation', 'p120')

However, V3-BH10 enhanced IL-2-induced mRNA expression of c-fos but not c-myc or junB.
('IL-2', 'Transcription', 'junB'),('IL-2', 'Transcription', 'c-fos'),('IL-2', 'Transcription', 'c-myc')

Thus, the binding of V3 loop of gp120 to the cell surface molecule(s) appears to affect intracellular IL-2 signaling, which leads to the suppression of IL-2-induced T cell growth.
('IL-2', 'Phosphorylation', 'p120')

We report here that interleukin 2 (IL-2) acts on human blood monocytes by enhancing binding activity of the transcription factor NF-kappa B to its consensus sequence in the 5' regulatory enhancer region of the IL-2 receptor alpha chain (p55).
('IL-2', 'Binding', 'IL-2 receptor alpha chain')

Enhanced NF-kappa B binding activity is followed by functional activation in that inducibility of the IL-2 receptor alpha chain is mediated by enhanced NF-kappa B binding and that a heterologous promoter containing the NF-kappa B consensus sequence (-291 to -245) of the IL-2 receptor alpha chain gene is activated.
('IL-2', 'Binding', 'IL-2 receptor alpha chain')

In addition, IL-2 is capable of increasing transcript levels of the p50 gene coding for the p50 subunit of the NF-kappa B transcription factor, whereas mRNA levels of the p65 NF-kappa B gene remained unchanged.

The role of RUNX1 and RUNX3 transcription factors in TGF-beta-mediated iT reg cell generation
('TGF-beta', 'Transcription', 'RUNX1'),('TGF-beta', 'Transcription', 'RUNX3')

Stimulation with anti-CD2/3/28 mAbs or TGF-beta alone resulted in a minimal up-regulation of RUNX1 and RUNX3 mRNA (Fig.
('TGF-beta', 'Transcription', 'RUNX1'),('TGF-beta', 'Transcription', 'RUNX3')

In contrast, the combination of both TGF-beta and anti-CD2/3/28 mAbs induced RUNX1 and RUNX3 mRNAs, as well as FOXP3 mRNA, within 48 h in naive CD4+ T cells.
('RUNX3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Transcription', 'RUNX1'),('RUNX', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Transcription', 'RUNX3'),('RUNX1', 'Transcription', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX3', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX3', 'Transcription', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Transcription', 'FOXP3')

Deficiency of RUNX1 or RUNX3 resulted in markedly reduced TGF-beta-mediated induction of FOXP3 mRNA in naive CD4+ T cells compared with control cells transfected with scrambled siRNA.
('RUNX3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Transcription', 'RUNX1'),('RUNX', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Transcription', 'RUNX3'),('RUNX1', 'Transcription', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX3', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX3', 'Transcription', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Transcription', 'FOXP3')

The level of FOXP3 mRNA was further reduced when both RUNX1 and RUNX3 were knocked down in naive CD4+ T cells during their differentiation to iT reg cells (Fig.
('RUNX3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Transcription', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX3', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX3', 'Transcription', 'FOXP3')

We observed no change in GATA3 expression in Th2 cells, T-bet expression in Th1 cells, or RORC2 mRNA expression in Th17 cells in which RUNX1 and RUNX3 were knocked down compared with control cells.
('RUNX1', 'Transcription', 'T-bet'),('RUNX3', 'Transcription', 'GATA3'),('RUNX1', 'Transcription', 'GATA3'),('RUNX1', 'Transcription', 'RORC2'),('RUNX3', 'Transcription', 'T-bet'),('RUNX3', 'Transcription', 'RORC2')

On the contrary, FOXP3 mRNA was significantly decreased in RUNX1- and RUNX3-deficient T reg cells compared with control cells (Fig.
('RUNX3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Transcription', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX3', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX3', 'Transcription', 'FOXP3')

The effect of RUNX silencing on the expression level of intracellular FOXP3 during naive CD4+ T cell differentiation to iT reg was evaluated by flow cytometry.
('RUNX', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

FOXP3 was only slightly reduced after RUNX1 silencing.
('RUNX', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Transcription', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3')

The most striking FOXP3 reduction was observed when RUNX1 and RUNX3 were silenced together (Fig.
('RUNX3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Transcription', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX3', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX3', 'Transcription', 'FOXP3')

The increased impact of combined RUNX1 and RUNX3 knockdown implies that RUNX1 and RUNX3 might have redundant functions in the induction of FOXP3.
('RUNX3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Transcription', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX3', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX3', 'Transcription', 'FOXP3')

In addition, the levels of IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-13, and IFN-gamma in control siRNA-transfected or RUNX1 and RUNX3 siRNA-transfected CD4+ T cells that were cultured with or without anti-CD2/3/28 mAb and TGF-beta did not show any significant difference (Fig.
('RUNX1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-13'),('RUNX3', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('RUNX3', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('RUNX3', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-5'),('RUNX3', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-4'),('RUNX1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-5'),('RUNX1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-4'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-4'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-13'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-5'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('RUNX1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('TGF-beta', 'Transcription', 'RUNX1'),('TGF-beta', 'Transcription', 'RUNX3'),('RUNX1', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('RUNX3', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-13')

As expected, IL-10, TGF-beta, and FOXP3 mRNAs are also expressed in circulating T reg cells (Fig.
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('TGF-beta', 'Transcription', 'FOXP3')

Staining of tonsil sections for FOXP3 and RUNX3 demonstrated in vivo coexpression of these two molecules in a subset of T reg cells, whereas there was low RUNX1 expression in all tonsil cells (Fig.
('RUNX3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Transcription', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX3', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX3', 'Transcription', 'FOXP3')

To define the requirements of Foxp3 with respect to inhibition of NF-kappaB-dependent transcription, we utilized a mutant of Foxp3 lacking the FKH domain (Figure 2A) [16], similar to the scurfy mutant Foxp3 of mice, and a mutant Foxp3 protein from a patient with IPEX [4,11,14,17].
('Foxp3', 'Localization', 'Foxp3')

Although Foxp3 interaction with NF-kappaB presumably takes place in the nucleus, it may also be possible for a cytoplasmic Foxp3 protein to bind to NF-kappaB in the cytoplasm and prevent localization to the nucleus following an activation stimulus.
('Foxp3', 'Localization', 'Foxp3')

Western blot analysis of NF-kappaB p65 expression demonstrated that Foxp3 and deltaFKH does not block NF-kappaB activation at the level of p65 protein expression (Figure 2E).
('deltaFKH', 'Gene_expression', 'p65'),('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'p65')

These results are very interesting with respect to Foxp3 function, because they suggest that the carboxyl-terminal FKH domain, and possibly nuclear localization, are dispensable for Foxp3 function in T cell populations.
('Foxp3', 'Localization', 'Foxp3')

Cooperation of binding sites for STAT6 and NF kappa B/rel in the IL-4-induced up-regulation of the human IgE germline promoter.
('IL-4', 'Binding', 'STAT6'),('STAT6', 'Positive_regulation', 'IgE')

In the case of IgE class switching, IL-4 activates the IgE germline promoter by inducing the interaction of the transcription factor STAT6 (IL-4STAT) with a responsive DNA element in the proximal region of the promoter.
('IL-4', 'Binding', 'STAT6'),('STAT6', 'Positive_regulation', 'IgE')

In addition, the combination of a NF kappa B/rel binding site and the STAT6 response element conferred IL-4 inducibility to a heterologous minimal promoter, while the individual sites had no effect.
('IL-4', 'Binding', 'STAT6')

The available data suggest that the NF kappa B2 nucleoprotein complex may cooperate with DNA-bound STAT6 to achieve IL-4-dependent activation of the human IgE germline gene.

Co-stimulation of T-lymphocytes by T-cell receptor (TcR) occupancy and activation of the CD28 surface molecule results in enhanced proliferation and interleukin 2 (IL-2) production.
('CD28', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2')

The increase in IL-2 gene expression triggered by CD28 involves a kappa B-like sequence in the 5'-regulatory region of the IL-2 promoter, called CD28-responsive element.

Sp1 is a critical factor for the monocytic specific expression of human CD14.
('Sp1', 'Gene_expression', 'CD14')

The Sp1 transcription factor bound to three different regions in the CD14 promoter.
('Sp1', 'Gene_expression', 'CD14')

Mutation of the major Sp1 binding site (-110 bp) decreased tissue-specific promoter activity, and these results, together with transactivation experiments, demonstrate that Sp1 plays a critical role in the tissue-specific expression of CD14 in monocytic cells.
('Sp1', 'Gene_expression', 'CD14')

CD14 Sp1 site oligonucleotides bound preferentially to a 105-kDa Sp1 species, which is present in higher relative levels in monocytic than non-monocytic cells, suggesting that modification of Sp1, such as phosphorylation, may explain how the Sp1 site mediates monocytic specific promoter activity.

('MCM6', 'Gene_expression', 'MCM5'),('MCM6', 'Regulation', 'MCM5'),('MCM5', 'Gene_expression', 'MCM6')

We evaluated the ability of eosinophil granule major basic protein (MBP) to stimulate interleukin (IL)-8 production by neutrophils.
('MBP', 'Gene_expression', 'interleukin (IL)-8')

MBP over the concentration range of 0.1 to 10 microM stimulated the release of up to approximately 8 ng/ml IL-8.
('MBP', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-8'),('MBP', 'Localization', 'IL-8')

Incubation with 2 microM MBP showed that, after a 1 h lag, the level of IL-8 release increased with time for approximately 10 h. At the 2 microM concentration, eosinophil cationic protein, eosinophil-derived neurotoxin, and eosinophil peroxidase did not stimulate significant levels of IL-8 production.
('MBP', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-8'),('MBP', 'Localization', 'IL-8')

MBP stimulated 2-fold increases in IL-8 messenger RNA (mRNA) after 1 and 3 h of incubation, which were blocked by pretreatment with actinomycin D. However, stimulation with MBP did not produce an increase in the binding activity of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB or activator protein-1.
('MBP', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-8'),('MBP', 'Localization', 'IL-8')

In addition, stimulation with MBP prolonged the stability of IL-8 mRNA.
('MBP', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-8'),('MBP', 'Localization', 'IL-8')

MBP also induced transient increases in mRNA for macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha and MIP-1beta, but did not stimulate the release of either chemokine.
('MBP', 'Localization', 'MIP-1beta'),('MBP', 'Localization', 'macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha')

These findings indicate that MBP is selective among the eosinophil granule proteins as a stimulus for neutrophil IL-8 release and, further, that stimulation of neutrophil IL-8 release by MBP involves both transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation.
('MBP', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-8'),('MBP', 'Localization', 'IL-8')

We postulate that MBP-induced release of IL-8 by neutrophils may contribute to the pathophysiology of acute asthma and other inflammatory lung diseases.

Tat enhances the NF-kappaB activity by hijacking IkappaB-alpha and inhibiting the post-activation turn off of NF-kappaB
('Tat', 'Binding', 'IkappaB-alpha')

Jurkat cells were transfected with siRNA Tat, siRNA control, or left untransfected, and 24 h later cells were infected with HXB2 Env-pseudotyped NL4-3.Luc.R-E- virions.
('siRNA Tat', 'Gene_expression', 'Tat')

The expression of Tat was detected at 1-h post-infection and progressively increased up to 12 h in untransfected and siRNA control-transfected cells, while it was barely detected in siRNA Tat-transfected cells (Figure 1A).
('siRNA Tat', 'Gene_expression', 'Tat')

The LTR-dependent luciferase expression was also progressively induced at 1- to 12-h post-infection in untransfected and siRNA control-transfected cells, while it was barely observed in siRNA Tat-transfected cells, as expected for the Tat-dependent transactivation of the HIV-1 LTR (Figure 1A).
('siRNA Tat', 'Gene_expression', 'Tat')

The progressive increase in NF-kappaB activity, as measured by p65-p50 binding to an NF-kappaB consensus oligonucleotide (Figure 1B) and nuclear p65 (Figure 1C, nucleus), was observed at 1- to 3-h post-infection in both Tat-positive (no siRNA or siRNA control) and Tat-negative (siRNA Tat) cells; however, at 12-h post-infection, the p65 DNA binding and nuclear p65 persisted elevated in presence of Tat (no siRNA and siRNA control), while they dropped in absence of Tat (siRNA Tat) (Figure 1B and C).
('Tat', 'Positive_regulation', 'p65'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65'),('Tat', 'Negative_regulation', 'p65'),('siRNA Tat', 'Gene_expression', 'Tat')

IkappaB-alpha was degraded in the cytosol within 3-h post-infection and de novo synthesized at 6 h with full replenishment at 12-h post-infection in both Tat-positive and Tat-negative cells (Figure 1C, cytosol).
('Tat', 'Binding', 'IkappaB-alpha')

These results indicated that in single-round HIV-1 infection the NF-kappaB activation initially correlated with the IKK activation and IkappaB-alpha degradation independently of the presence of Tat, and it was kept elevated in presence of Tat following the decay of the IKK activity and new synthesis of IkappaB-alpha.
('Tat', 'Binding', 'IkappaB-alpha')

In un-stimulated cells, the p65 DNA binding (Figure 2A) and nuclear p65 (Figure 2B, nucleus) were slightly enhanced by Tat, while the IkappaB-alpha content was not significantly affected (Figure 2B, cytosol).
('Tat', 'Positive_regulation', 'p65'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'IkappaB-alpha'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65'),('Tat', 'Negative_regulation', 'p65')

Transient stimulation with PMA increased the NF-kappaB DNA binding activity and nuclear p65 at 5 min peaking at 60-120 min independently of the presence of Tat (Figure 2A and B); however, while the p65 DNA binding and nuclear p65 persisted elevated at 240-min post-treatment in Tat-positive cells, they dropped in Tat-negative cells (Figure 2A and B).
('Tat', 'Positive_regulation', 'p65'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65'),('Tat', 'Negative_regulation', 'p65')

Degradation of IkappaB-alpha was progressively induced at 5-30 min, followed by de novo synthesis at 60 min with full replenishment at 240 min in both Tat-positive and negative cells (Figure 2B, cytosol).
('Tat', 'Binding', 'IkappaB-alpha')

These results indicated that Tat enhanced the NF-kappaB activity in un-stimulated and PMA-stimulated cells without affecting the IKK activity and IkappaB-alpha content.
('Tat', 'Binding', 'IkappaB-alpha')

As we previously found that Tat binds to the sixth ankyrin of IkappaB-alpha (50,51), we tested whether Tat counteracted the generation of the IkappaB-alpha/NF-kappaB complex.
('Tat', 'Binding', 'IkappaB-alpha')

Coimmunoprecipitation of IkappaB-alpha with p65 was detected at 0- and 240-min post-treatment in Tat-negative cells (Figure 2D, lanes 1 and 3), and was halved in Tat-positive cells, where Tat coimmunoprecipitated with IkappaB-alpha (Figure 2D, lanes 2 and 4), indicating that Tat competed the IkappaB-alpha binding to p65.

To define the requirements of Foxp3 with respect to inhibition of NF-kappaB-dependent transcription, we utilized a mutant of Foxp3 lacking the FKH domain (Figure 2A) [16], similar to the scurfy mutant Foxp3 of mice, and a mutant Foxp3 protein from a patient with IPEX [4,11,14,17].
('Foxp3', 'Localization', 'Foxp3')

Although Foxp3 interaction with NF-kappaB presumably takes place in the nucleus, it may also be possible for a cytoplasmic Foxp3 protein to bind to NF-kappaB in the cytoplasm and prevent localization to the nucleus following an activation stimulus.
('Foxp3', 'Localization', 'Foxp3')

Western blot analysis of NF-kappaB p65 expression demonstrated that Foxp3 and DeltaFKH does not block NF-kappaB activation at the level of p65 protein expression (Figure 2E).
('DeltaFKH', 'Gene_expression', 'p65'),('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'p65')

These results are very interesting with respect to Foxp3 function, because they suggest that the carboxyl-terminal FKH domain, and possibly nuclear localization, are dispensable for Foxp3 function in T cell populations.
('Foxp3', 'Localization', 'Foxp3')

CD28 costimulation augments IL-2 secretion of activated lamina propria T cells by increasing mRNA stability without enhancing IL-2 gene transactivation.
('CD28', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-2'),('IL-2', 'Localization', 'IL-2'),('CD28', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2'),('CD28', 'Localization', 'IL-2')

Coligation of CD28 leads to synergistic enhancement of IL-2 secretion.
('CD28', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-2'),('CD28', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2'),('CD28', 'Localization', 'IL-2')

Previous studies have characterized the CD28 augmentation of TCR-mediated signaling in peripheral blood T cells through transcriptional activation of an IL-2 promoter CD28 response element (CD28RE), along with enhanced mRNA stability.
('CD28', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-2'),('CD28', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2'),('CD28', 'Localization', 'IL-2')

This study characterized molecular events involved in CD28 costimulation of IL-2 production in LP mononuclear cells (LPMC).
('CD28', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-2'),('CD28', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2'),('CD28', 'Localization', 'IL-2')

LPMC exhibited increased IL-2 production in response to CD28 costimulation, compared with cells activated through CD2 alone.
('CD28', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-2'),('CD28', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2'),('CD28', 'Localization', 'IL-2')

IL-2 secretion was paralleled by increased expression of IL-2 mRNA, resulting from enhanced IL-2 mRNA stability.
('IL-2', 'Localization', 'IL-2')

In contrast to transcriptional activation in PBMC, EMSA revealed that CD28 coligation of CD2-activated LPMC does not result in increased binding of trans-factors to the CD28RE, nor did Western blots detect changes in I-kappaBalpha or I-kappaBbeta levels following CD28 coligation.
('CD28', 'Gene_expression', 'I-kappaBalpha'),('CD28', 'Gene_expression', 'I-kappaBbeta')

Furthermore, CD28 coligation fails to enhance IL-2 promoter-reporter or RE/AP construct expression in CD2-activated LPMC.
('CD28', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-2'),('CD28', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2'),('CD28', 'Localization', 'IL-2')

The results reported herein indicate that the molecular mechanisms involved in CD28 cosignaling and regulation of IL-2 secretion in LP T cells are unique to that compartment and differ from those seen in peripheral blood T cells.

Regulation of Id3 cell cycle function by Cdk-2-dependent phosphorylation.
('Cdk-2', 'Phosphorylation', 'Id3')

Recently, cyclin E-Cdk2- and cyclin A-Cdk2-dependent phosphorylation of a single conserved serine residue (Ser5) in Id2 has been shown to occur during late G1-to-S phase transition of the cell cycle, and this neutralizes the function of Id2 in abrogating E-box-dependent bHLH homo- or heterodimer complex formation in vitro (E.Hara, M.Hall, and G.Peters, EMBO J.16:332-342, 1997).
('cyclin E', 'Phosphorylation', 'Id2'),('cyclin A', 'Phosphorylation', 'Id2'),('Cdk2', 'Phosphorylation', 'Id2')

We now show that an analogous cell-cycle-regulated phosphorylation of Id3 alters the specificity of Id3 for abrogating both E-box-dependent bHLH homo- or heterodimer complex formation in vitro and E-box-dependent reporter gene function in vivo.
('Id3', 'Regulation', 'Id3')

Furthermore, compared with wild-type Id3, an Id3 Asp5 mutant (mimicking phosphorylation) is unable to promote cell cycle S phase entry in transfected fibroblasts, whereas an Id3 Ala5 mutant (ablating phosphorylation) displays an activity significantly greater than that of wild-type Id3 protein.
('Id3', 'Regulation', 'Id3')

The c-jun gene expression was very transient and was not detectable by 60 min after M-CSF addition.
('M-CSF', 'Gene_expression', 'c-jun')

Material immunoprecipitated with an isotype control antibody (isotype) or anti-CD40 antibody was examined by Western blotting for CD40, TRAF2, TRAF3, cIAP1, HOIP, IKKalpha/beta, and IKKgamma (right panels).
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'IKKgamma')

(C) To further evaluate HOIP-dependent recruitment of IKKgamma to CD40, A20.2J cells or HOIP-deficient (HOIP-/-) A20.2J cells were transduced with an empty retroviral vector or a retroviral construct encoding BP epitope-tagged IKKgamma (noted in the figure as pMIP and IKKgamma, respectively).

IL-10 Production by Th1 Cells Requires ERK1 and ERK2 Activation
('ERK2', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('ERK1', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10')

Our data showed that the maintenance of IL-10 induction in Th1 cells required stimulation with high antigen dose, which to some extent could be compensated for by the addition of IL-12.
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Although the apparent peak and amount of ERK1 and ERK2 activation varied slightly between experiments, a consistent finding was that high antigen dose differentiated Th1 cells always showed enhanced and prolonged ERK1 and ERK2 activation in the presence of IL-12, regardless of whether they were restimulated with high or low antigen dose (Figure5B).
('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'ERK1'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'ERK2')

We then investigated whether ERK1 and ERK2 activation was required for the induction of IL-10 in Th1 cells by using U0126 (Figure5C), a compound that blocks downstream ERK activation.
('ERK2', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('ERK1', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10')

As in the APC-driven cultures, stronger TCR stimulation together with IL-12 led to higher percentages of cells producing both IL-10 and IFN-gamma after 1 week of culture (Figure5C).
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Because U0126 inhibits the MEK5-catalyzed activation of ERK5, as well as the MEK1- and MEK2-catalyzed activation of ERK1 and ERK2 (Bain etal., 2007; Mody etal., 2001), we also used the more specific, structurally unrelated MEK1 and MEK2 inhibitor PD184352 at concentrations in which it inhibits MEK1 and MEK2 but not MEK5 (Bain etal., 2007; Mody etal., 2001).
('MEK2', 'Positive_regulation', 'ERK1'),('MEK5', 'Positive_regulation', 'ERK5'),('MEK1', 'Positive_regulation', 'ERK2'),('MEK1', 'Positive_regulation', 'ERK1'),('MEK2', 'Positive_regulation', 'ERK2')

Upon addition of inhibitors to othersignaling pathways, including a p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB203580, or the GSK3beta inhibitor, CT99021 (Bain etal., 2007), no effect on IL-10 production was observed (FigureS5B).
('p38 MAPK', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('GSK3beta', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Our data thus suggested that IL-10 production by Th1 cells in response to high antigen dose and IL-12 requires ERK1 and ERK2 signaling, but not the activation of the p38 or the GSK3beta pathways.
('ERK2', 'Positive_regulation', 'p38'),('ERK2', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('ERK1', 'Positive_regulation', 'GSK3beta'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'ERK1'),('ERK2', 'Positive_regulation', 'GSK3beta'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'ERK2'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('ERK1', 'Positive_regulation', 'p38'),('GSK3beta', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('ERK1', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10')

We also found that the recruitment of HOIP to CD40 was TRAF2-dependent and that overexpression of a truncated HOIP mutant partially inhibited CD40-mediated NF-kappaB activation.
('TRAF2', 'Binding', 'HOIP')

A low amount of transcription of Ifngamma was induced by IL-12 when cells were differentiated with low antigen dose, but this effect of IL-12 was markedly upregulated with increasing doses of antigen (Figure6A).
('IL-12', 'Transcription', 'Ifngamma'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'Ifngamma')

However, IL-12 induced a high amount of Il10 transcription as well as Ifngamma expression with increased antigen doses (Figure6A), again in keeping with the protein data (Figure1A).
('IL-12', 'Transcription', 'Ifngamma'),('IL-12', 'Transcription', 'Il10'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'Ifngamma')

In contrast, high amounts of GATA-3 mRNA expression were only observed under Th2 cell differentiation conditions (low-dose antigen) (Figure6B), and this expression was markedly downregulated by both increasing antigen dose and coculture in IL-12 (Figure6B).
('IL-12', 'Transcription', 'GATA-3')

Interestingly, IL-12 sustained the high expression of c-Maf mRNA even at the highest antigen dose (Figure6B).
('IL-12', 'Transcription', 'c-Maf')

Moreover, IL-12 maintenance of c-maf expression required STAT4 activation (data not shown).
('c-maf', 'Positive_regulation', 'STAT4'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'c-maf')

We showed also that like Il10 expression, c-maf expression was inhibited in Th1 and Th17 cells in the presence of the MEK1 and MEK2 inhibitor (PD184352), whereas T-bet and RORgammat expression was hardly affected (Figure6D).

Wild-Type and LMP1 Transgenic Lymphoma Cells Do Not Require IL4 and Stat6 Signaling
('IL4', 'Phosphorylation', 'Stat6')

Activated Stat6 (pStat6), a target of the IL4 receptor pathway, was detected in the wild-type and LMP1 transgenic lymphocytes (Figure 4B).
('IL4', 'Phosphorylation', 'Stat6')

However, the pathway was not disabled, as treatment of the lymphoma cells with IL4 induced Stat6 phosphorylation (Figure 4C).
('IL4', 'Phosphorylation', 'Stat6')

In summary, the wild-type and LMP1 transgenic lymphoma cells grew independently of IL4 treatment and did not require Stat6 signaling.

GATA3 Is a Negative Regulator of FOXP3 Expression
('GATA3', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

FOXP3 expression decreased once GATA3 expression is high; therefore, we hypothesized a potential role for GATA3 in repressing FOXP3.
('GATA3', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

Besides GATA3's well-known positive effect on gene regulation, GATA3's repressive capabilities were previously shown to restrict Th1 commitment by inhibiting STAT4 expression [2,21], and therefore GATA3 prevents differentiation into Th1 cells.
('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'STAT4')

To investigate whether GATA3 can directly inhibit FOXP3 induction, we transduced GATA3 or a truncated GATA3 lacking the DNA-binding domain in human primary CD4+CD45RA+ T cells using a TAT-fused, recombinantly expressed GATA3.
('GATA3', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

TAT-GATA3 reduced FOXP3 expression in a dose-dependent manner, whereas a DNA-binding domain truncated version (TAT-DeltaDBD-GATA3) did not affect FOXP3 expression as compared with expression in untransduced cells (Figure 7A).
('GATA3', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('TAT-GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

In addition, we analyzed the inhibitory effect of GATA3 on FOXP3 in transgenic DO11.10 mice, constitutively overexpressing GATA3 under the control of the CD2 locus control region (DO11.10xCD2-GATA3).
('GATA3', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

To investigate the effect of GATA3 on iTreg, CD4+CD62L+CD25- cells were isolated, activated with OVA in the presence or absence of TGF-beta, and Foxp3 expression was analyzed after 4 d. The naive CD4+CD25- cells were Foxp3- (unpublished data).
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3'),('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3')

As described for the human cells, TGF-beta dramatically up-regulated Foxp3 in the DO11.10 littermate control mice.
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3')

In contrast, cells from the CD2-GATA3xDO11.10 mice showed dramatically reduced Foxp3 expression when activated with TGF-beta and OVA (Figure 7B).
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3'),('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3')

In this study the effect of IL-10 on the expression of the protooncogene c-fos was investigated, because Fos plays a potential role in the regulation of B cell proliferation and differentiation.
('IL-10', 'Gene_expression', 'c-fos')

A significant 2-4 fold increase of c-fos expression was observed within 30 min of stimulation with IL-10 (p < 0.01).
('IL-10', 'Gene_expression', 'c-fos')

The IL-10 effect on c-fos expression was not blocked by polymyxin B.
('IL-10', 'Gene_expression', 'c-fos')

Using the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein (10 microM) a complete inhibition of IL-10 induced c-fos expression was observed.
('IL-10', 'Gene_expression', 'c-fos')

In addition, H-7 (10 microM), a specific inhibitor of serine/threonine kinases, significantly blocked IL-10 mediated c-fos expression (p < 0.05).
('IL-10', 'Gene_expression', 'c-fos')

In conclusion, these data show that IL-10 induces c-fos expression in human B-cells by activation of tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases.
('IL-10', 'Gene_expression', 'c-fos')

The interleukin 2 receptor alpha-chain (IL-2R alpha) gene is a key regulator of lymphocyte proliferation.
('IL-2', 'Transcription', 'IL-2R alpha')

IL-2R alpha is rapidly and potently induced in T cells in response to mitogenic stimuli.
('IL-2', 'Transcription', 'IL-2R alpha')

Interleukin 2 (IL-2) stimulates IL-2R alpha transcription, thereby amplifying expression of its own high-affinity receptor.
('IL-2', 'Transcription', 'IL-2R alpha')

IL-2R alpha transcription is at least in part controlled by two positive regulatory regions, PRRI and PRRII.
('IL-2', 'Transcription', 'IL-2R alpha')

However, none of these proximal regions account for the induction of IL-2R alpha transcription by IL-2.
('IL-2', 'Transcription', 'IL-2R alpha')

To find new regulatory regions of the IL-2R alpha gene, 8.5 kb of the 5' end noncoding sequence of the IL-2R alpha gene have been sequenced.
('IL-2', 'Transcription', 'IL-2R alpha')

To confirm the physiological relevance of these findings, we carried out in vivo footprinting experiments which showed that stimulation of IL-2R alpha expression correlated with occupancy of the GASd element.
('IL-2', 'Transcription', 'IL-2R alpha')

Our data demonstrate a major role of the GASd/EBSd element in IL-2R alpha regulation and suggest that the T-cell-specific Elf-1 factor can serve as a transcriptional repressor.
('IL-2', 'Transcription', 'IL-2R alpha')

Cotransfection of NF-kappa B (p50/p65)- or AP-1 (c-Jun/c-Fos)- expression vectors into Jurkat cells with a luciferase reporter containing the GM-CSF promoter did not stimulate transcription from the GM-CSF promoter.

Surprisingly, we find also that the interaction between SLP-76 and Vav is not required for their cooperation in augmenting IL-2 promoter activity, as the two molecules appear to function in different signaling pathways upstream of IL-2 gene expression.
('SLP-76', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-2'),('Vav', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2'),('SLP-76', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2')

Additionally, overexpression of Vav, but not SLP-76, augments CD28-induced IL-2 promoter activity.
('SLP-76', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-2'),('Vav', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2'),('SLP-76', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2')

These findings suggest that the synergy between SLP-76 and Vav in regulating IL-2 gene expression reflects the cooperation between different signaling pathways.

Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Tat upregulates interleukin-2 secretion in activated T cells.
('Tat', 'Localization', 'interleukin-2')

To investigate the effects of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Tat on interleukin-2 (IL-2) expression, we used IL-2 promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase constructs and IL-2-secreting Jurkat T cells as a model system.
('Tat', 'Transcription', 'IL-2'),('Tat', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2'),('Tat', 'Localization', 'interleukin-2')

Transient expression of HIV-1 Tat induced a five- to eightfold increase in IL-2 promoter activity in Jurkat T cells stimulated with phytohemagglutinin and phorbol myristate acetate.
('Tat', 'Transcription', 'IL-2'),('Tat', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2')

IL-2 secretion was increased more than twofold in both Jurkat T cells and primary T cells stimulated by extracellular HIV-1 Tat protein.
('Tat', 'Transcription', 'IL-2'),('Tat', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2')

Analysis of mRNA suggested that Tat exerts its effect on IL-2 primarily at the transcriptional level.
('Tat', 'Transcription', 'IL-2'),('Tat', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2')

The NF-kappa B site at positions -206 to -195 of the IL-2 promoter was required but not sufficient for the Tat effect.
('Tat', 'Transcription', 'IL-2'),('Tat', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2')

The Tat-mediated increase in IL-2 promoter activity could selectively be blocked by antisense tat or-unlike the analogous effect of human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 Tax-by cyclosporin A.

Regulation of IL-6 synthesis in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells by C3a and C3a(desArg).

In this study we investigated the effects of C3a and C3a(desArg) on gene expression and protein secretion of IL-6 in human PBMCs, either alone or in combination with LPS or IL-1beta.
('C3a(desArg)', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-6'),('C3a', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-6'),('IL-1beta', 'Localization', 'IL-6'),('C3a', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-6'),('IL-1beta', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-6'),('C3a', 'Localization', 'IL-6'),('C3a(desArg)', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-6'),('C3a(desArg)', 'Localization', 'IL-6')

C3a or C3a(desArg) alone exhibited no effect on the expression or secretion of IL-6.

However, when PBMC were stimulated with LPS or IL-1beta, both C3a and C3a(desArg) were found to enhance IL-6 release by PBMC in a dose-dependent manner.
('C3a(desArg)', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-6'),('C3a', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-6'),('IL-1beta', 'Localization', 'IL-6'),('C3a', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-6'),('IL-1beta', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-6'),('C3a', 'Localization', 'IL-6'),('C3a(desArg)', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-6'),('C3a(desArg)', 'Localization', 'IL-6')

Since C3a has been shown to induce PGE2 production by monocytes, and PGE2 has been shown to influence cytokine production, we investigated the potential role of PGE2 in C3a-mediated enhancement of LPS- and IL-1beta-induced IL-6 production.
('C3a', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-6'),('IL-1beta', 'Localization', 'IL-6'),('C3a', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-6'),('IL-1beta', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-6'),('C3a', 'Localization', 'IL-6')

Indomethacin blocked PGE2 release, but had no influence on the observed effects of C3a, suggesting that the effects of C3a on IL-6 production are independent of PGE2 formation by monocytes.
('C3a', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-6'),('C3a', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-6'),('C3a', 'Localization', 'IL-6')

p21ras initiates Rac-1 but not phosphatidyl inositol 3 kinase/PKB, mediated signaling pathways in T lymphocytes.

('Rac-1', 'Regulation', 'p21ras'),('p21ras', 'Positive_regulation', 'Akt')

In contrast, p21ras signals are unable to induce Akt/PKB activity in T cell nor is Ras function required for Akt/PKB activation in response to the TCR.

Whereas different anti-CD4 mAb or HIV-1 gp120 could all trigger activation of the protein tyrosine kinases p56lck and p59fyn and phosphorylation of the Shc adaptor protein, which mediates signals to Ras, they differed significantly in their ability to activate NF-AT.

Surprisingly, even p65, but not c-rel, was phosphorylated after induction in vivo, suggesting that TNF-alpha selectively activates only specific NF-kappa B heteromers and that modifications regulate not only I kappa B molecules but also NF-kappa B molecules.

The same gene segment was not transcribed in IL-5-nonproducing T cell clones, suggesting that human T cell IL-5 synthesis is regulated at the transcriptional level.

We demonstrate that IKKbeta-mediated RPS3 S209 phosphorylation represents a critical determinant in governing its nuclear import thus unveiling a novel mechanism behind NF-kappaB regulatory specificity.
('IKKbeta', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3')

The recent observation that human IKKbeta displayed CK2-like phosphorylation specificity29 coincides with our evidence that recombinant IKKbeta, but not IKKalpha, phosphorylated RPS3.
('IKKbeta', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3')

CK2 was previously shown to phosphorylate p65 and to bind to and phosphorylate IKKbeta41-43, however, we ruled out the possibility that the IKKbeta-bound CK2 could account for the observed RPS3 phosphorylation because no CK2 was detected in the IKKbeta preparations used for the in vitro kinase assay.
('IKKbeta', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3')

Because RPS3 only harbors the CK2 motif and not a traditional IKK motif, this RPS3 regulatory function could explain why IKK harbors the alternative substrate phosphorylation capability.
('RPS3', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

IKKbeta-mediated RPS3 S209 phosphorylation is a critical target modulated by this pathogen to subvert host NF-kappaB signaling.
('IKKbeta', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3')

The bacterial effector NleH1 specifically binds to RPS3 once injected into host cells and profoundly suppresses NF-kappaB and its attendant protective immune responses9.
('NleH1', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3')

Our data now show that NleH1 selectively inhibits RPS3 phosphorylation, thus retarding its nuclear translocation and subsequent NF-kappaB function, without altering other NF-kappaB signaling.
('NleH1', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3')

Although NleH1 did not directly phosphorylate IKKbeta, its kinase activity was required to inhibit IKKbeta-mediated RPS3 S209 phosphorylation.
('NleH1', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('IKKbeta', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3')

NleH1 attenuates the transcription of RPS3-dependent, but not all, NF-kappaB target genes, in particular those genes associated with acute proinflammatory responses, including IL8 and TNF.
('NleH1', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3')

In contrast, NleH1 does not block NF-kappaB p65 nuclear translocation, which suggests that certain p65-dependent but RPS3-independent NF-kappaB target genes might thus be beneficial for E. coli O157:H7 to replicate and disseminate in the host.
('NleH1', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('NleH1', 'Localization', 'p65')

By selectively inhibiting RPS3 and its attendant NF-kappaB function with NleH1, the pathogen achieves the ability to increase colonization and diarrhea yet limiting the mortality of the host.
('NleH1', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3')

EBNA-2 trans-activates cellular and viral genes like CD23, c-fgr, latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) and terminal protein 1 (TP1).
('EBNA-2', 'Positive_regulation', 'LMP'),('EBNA-2', 'Gene_expression', 'LMP')

EBNA-2 is able to trans-activate the expression of the LMP gene in several cell lines.
('EBNA-2', 'Positive_regulation', 'LMP'),('EBNA-2', 'Gene_expression', 'LMP')

Various reports have delineated the cis-acting elements of the LMP promoter through which EBNA-2 mediates trans-activation.
('EBNA-2', 'Positive_regulation', 'LMP'),('EBNA-2', 'Gene_expression', 'LMP')

To determine whether EBNA-2 also trans-activates the LMP promoter by protein-protein interactions, we performed a series of gel retardation assays and competition experiments with LMP promoter fragments of different sizes.
('EBNA-2', 'Positive_regulation', 'LMP'),('EBNA-2', 'Gene_expression', 'LMP')

However, analysis of sucrose gradient fractions in the gel retardation assay provided evidence that the LMP promoter-binding proteins form a complex of higher M(r) in EBNA-2-positive cell extracts.
('EBNA-2', 'Positive_regulation', 'LMP'),('EBNA-2', 'Gene_expression', 'LMP')

We deduce from these results that EBNA-2-positive cells might indeed contain specific complexes bound to the LMP promoter which are, however, too labile to be detected in a standard gel retardation assay.

BMP-6 inhibits growth of mature human B cells; induction of Smad phosphorylation and upregulation of Id1
('Smad', 'Positive_regulation', 'Id1')

The B cells were found to express BMP type I and type II receptors and BMP-6 rapidly induced phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8.
('BMP-6', 'Phosphorylation', '8'),('BMP-6', 'Phosphorylation', 'Smad1'),('BMP-6', 'Phosphorylation', '5')

Furthermore, Smad-phosphorylation was followed by upregulation of Id1 mRNA and Id1 protein, whereas Id2 and Id3 expression was not affected.
('Smad', 'Gene_expression', 'Id3'),('Smad', 'Positive_regulation', 'Id1'),('Smad', 'Gene_expression', 'Id2')

In mature human B cells, BMP-6 inhibited cell growth, and rapidly induced phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8 followed by an upregulation of Id1.

Activation of the erythropoietin receptor caused specific DNA-binding of Stat 5b, but failed to induce reporter gene transcription.
('erythropoietin receptor', 'Binding', 'Stat 5b')

The current study clearly demonstrates that IL-2 does not induce I kappa B alpha degradation or NF-kappa B activation in primary human T cells that respond to IL-2 by entering the cell cycle and avoiding apoptosis.
('IL-2', 'Protein_catabolism', 'I kappa B alpha')

However, this deletion mutation prevented the induced phosphorylation, degradative loss, and functional release of I kappa B alpha from NF-kappa B in Tax-expressing cells.
('Tax', 'Phosphorylation', 'I kappa B alpha'),('Tax', 'Protein_catabolism', 'I kappa B alpha')

Alanine substitutions introduced at two serine residues positioned within this N-terminal regulatory region of I kappa B alpha also yielded constitutive repressors that escaped from Tax-induced turnover and that potently inhibited immune activation pathways for NF-kappa B induction, including those initiated from antigen and cytokine receptors.

Overexpression of NF-IL6 enhanced expression of the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase reporter gene linked to the PRE-I-thymidine kinase or the human IL-4 promoter more than 10-fold in Jurkat cells.

Although GABP expression is not restricted to the hematopoietic lineage, its interaction with other specific factors may contribute to the tissue-specific expression of the gammac gene.

Importantly, BMP-6 induced a rapid and marked increase in Smad-1/5/8 phosphorylation.
('BMP-6', 'Phosphorylation', 'Smad')

Furthermore, the BMP-6 induced Smad phosphorylation was followed by a selective upregulation of Id1 mRNA and subsequent Id1 protein.
('Smad', 'Positive_regulation', 'Id1'),('BMP-6', 'Positive_regulation', 'Id1'),('BMP-6', 'Phosphorylation', 'Smad')

Furthermore, BMP-2 has been shown to induce activation of STAT3 in myeloma cells [9].
('BMP-2', 'Positive_regulation', 'STAT3')

Upregulation of Id1 via Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation is a known mechanism for BMP-6 signalling in other cell systems [31,32] and regulation of Id-proteins is thought to be an important mechanism for Smad-signalling [17].
('Smad1', 'Positive_regulation', 'Id1'),('Smad', 'Positive_regulation', 'Id1'),('5', 'Positive_regulation', 'Id1'),('BMP-6', 'Positive_regulation', 'Id1'),('BMP-6', 'Phosphorylation', 'Smad'),('8', 'Positive_regulation', 'Id1')

In the present study, real-time RT-PCR experiments revealed a specific four-fold upregulation for Id1 in BMP-6-treated B cells, while the amount of Id2-Id4 remained unchanged.
('BMP-6', 'Positive_regulation', 'Id1'),('BMP-6', 'Gene_expression', 'Id2'),('BMP-6', 'Gene_expression', 'Id4')

Previously, Id1 has been considered not to be expressed in later developmental stages than pro-B cells [33,34], and its constitutive expression has been reported to impair mouse B cell development [35].
('5', 'Positive_regulation', 'Id1')

However, BMP-6 did not induce significant changes in the protein expression of Id2 and Id3.
('BMP-6', 'Gene_expression', 'Id2')

The antiproliferative and death inducing effect of BMP-6 in B cells with concomitant upregulation of Id1 protein is therefore in line with the view that Id proteins are required for the induction of growth arrest and apoptosis in B-lymphocyte progenitors by TGF-beta [40].
('BMP-6', 'Positive_regulation', 'Id1')

In this respect, it is of interest that targeted expression of Id1 to B-lymphocytes resulted in aberrant B cell development, massive apoptosis, and subsequent development of B cell lymphomas [35].
('5', 'Positive_regulation', 'Id1')

Moreover, BMP-6 has been suggested to play a role in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) [43,44] and elevated levels of Id1 and Id3 have been found in the synovia of RA-patients [45].

RFLAT-1: a new zinc finger transcription factor that activates RANTES gene expression in T lymphocytes.
('RFLAT-1', 'Gene_expression', 'RANTES')

Using expression cloning, we identified the first "late" T lymphocyte associated transcription factor and named it "RANTES Factor of Late Activated T Lymphocytes-1" (RFLAT-1).
('RFLAT-1', 'Gene_expression', 'RANTES')

RFLAT-1 is a novel, phosphorylated, zinc finger transcription factor that is expressed in T cells 3 days after activation, coincident with RANTES expression.
('RFLAT-1', 'Gene_expression', 'RANTES')

While Rel proteins play the dominant role in RANTES gene expression in fibroblasts, RFLAT-1 is a strong transactivator for RANTES in T cells.
('RFLAT-1', 'Gene_expression', 'RANTES')

The CD4+CD25-, CD45RA+, CD45RO+, and CD4+CD45RO+CD25- were able to significantly induce FOXP3 mRNA up to 30-fold upon TCR activation and addition of TGF-beta.
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

Th2 cells are known to produce IL-4 upon activation, which may interact with TGF-beta signaling and thus prevent FOXP3 induction.
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

However, the neutralization of IL-4 with a blocking IL-4 antibody did not rescue FOXP3 expression in the differentiated Th2 cells (unpublished data).
('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

Repeated exposure to TGF-beta did not further increase the FOXP3 expression in the iTreg lineage but transiently induced FOXP3 expression in Th1 cells.
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

Naturally occurring Th2 cells such as CRTH2+ T cells, T cells isolated according to their IL-4 secretion, or an IL-4-producing T cell clone (BR8) were also lacking FOXP3 expression (Figure 2B).
('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

Furthermore TGF-beta-mediated FOXP3 induction failed in these cells in contrast to the naive T cells (Figure 2B).
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

Because IL-4 is the key Th2 cytokine, the expression of IL-4 and FOXP3 in freshly isolated CD4+ T cells was analyzed by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS).
('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

IL-4-expressing cells were most abundant among CD45RO+CD25- cells, which did not co-express FOXP3 (Figure 3A, left panel).
('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

In contrast, CD45RO+CD25+ cells abundantly expressed FOXP3, while lacking IL-4 (Figure 3A, right panel).
('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

As shown in Figure 3B, the frequency of the IL-4+ cells was always below 1% in the FOXP3+ cells close to the background.

The role of p16 in the E2F-dependent thymidine kinase regulation.
('p16', 'Regulation', 'thymidine kinase')

Phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein by cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 prevents its interaction with the transcription factor E2F, which subsequently promotes the expression of S phase regulated genes, such as thymidine kinase.
('6', 'Phosphorylation', 'retinoblastoma protein'),('cyclin-dependent kinases 4', 'Phosphorylation', 'retinoblastoma protein')

We investigated the regulation of thymidine kinase in phytohemagglutinin-stimulated normal human lymphocytes and in the p16-negative human acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines, MOLT-4 and CEM.
('p16', 'Regulation', 'thymidine kinase')

Transient expression of p16 in normal human lymphocytes caused arrest in G1, but was without effect on the cell growth of MOLT-4 and CEM cells, although all of them express functional retinoblastoma protein.
('6', 'Phosphorylation', 'retinoblastoma protein')

Nevertheless, in the two leukemia cell lines transient overexpression of p16 reestablished the normal regulation of thymidine kinase, paralleled by an increase of the underphosphorylated form of retinoblastoma protein and decrease of free E2F bound to its motif in the thymidine kinase promoter.
('6', 'Phosphorylation', 'retinoblastoma protein'),('p16', 'Regulation', 'thymidine kinase')

We demonstrate that loss of p16 causes upregulation of this DNA precursor pathway enzyme via activation of E2F by a mechanism involving retinoblastoma protein.
('6', 'Phosphorylation', 'retinoblastoma protein')

Triggering of HLA class II antigens by the anti-HLA-DR monoclonal antibody (mAb) L243 significantly (P < 0.05) and differentially enhanced the release of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) by the non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cells Ri-I, Ci-I, and Sc-I, which are at a distinct stage of B-cell differentiation, and by the more mature Burkitt lymphoma cell Raji; in contrast, it did not induce TNF-alpha release by the pre-B leukemia cells Nalm-6 and BV173.
('TNF-alpha', 'Localization', 'TNF-alpha')

TNF-alpha release peaked at 24 h and decreased thereafter, and it was dose dependent and preceded by an increase of TNF-alpha mRNA detectable after 3 h of stimulation with mAb L243.
('TNF-alpha', 'Localization', 'TNF-alpha')

Secreted TNF-alpha mediated the enhancement of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) and activator protein-1 (AP-1) binding activity; in fact, the triggering of HLA-DR antigens in the presence of antihuman TNF-alpha-neutralizing antibodies did not upregulate NF-kappa B and AP-1.
('TNF-alpha', 'Localization', 'TNF-alpha')

Altogether, our data demonstrate that: (a) the ability of B cells to release TNF-alpha after triggering of HLA-DR antigens depends on their stage of differentiation; (b) levels of released TNF-alpha seem to correlate with the stage of B-cell maturation but do not correlate with the amounts of cell surface HLA-DR antigens; (c) secreted TNF-alpha regulates the levels of expression of NF-kappa B and AP-1 by an autocrine loop; and (d) intracellular signals mediating TNF-alpha release by B cells are distinct from those regulating homotypic aggregation and proliferation.
('TNF-alpha', 'Localization', 'TNF-alpha')

By using Jurkat and primary human T lymphocytes, we demonstrate that the simultaneous activation of two second messengers of the TCR-initiated signal transduction, protein kinase C (PKC) and calcineurin, results in the synergistic activation of the IkappaBalpha kinase (IKK) complex but not of another putative IkappaBalpha kinase, p90(rsk).
('p90(rsk)', 'Phosphorylation', 'IkappaBalpha')

We also demonstrate that the IKK complex, but not p90(rsk), is responsible for the in vivo phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha mediated by the co-activation of PKC and calcineurin.
('p90(rsk)', 'Phosphorylation', 'IkappaBalpha')

Tat counteracts the IkappaB-alpha inhibition of p65 by competing the repressor binding
('Tat', 'Binding', 'IkappaB-alpha'),('IkappaB-alpha', 'Binding', 'p65')

We further investigated the physical interaction of Tat with IkappaB-alpha using in vitro translated proteins in coimmunoprecipitation assays.
('Tat', 'Binding', 'IkappaB-alpha')

For mapping the interaction domains, we used the following Tat mutants: Tat T,N(23,24)A, Tat C(22,25,27)A, Tat K(50,51)A and Tat R(49-57)A (Figure 3A).
('Tat', 'Binding', 'Tat')

IkappaB-alpha coimmunoprecipitated with all Tat proteins, except Tat R(49-57)A (Figure 3B).
('Tat', 'Binding', 'IkappaB-alpha'),('Tat R(49-57)A', 'Binding', 'IkappaB-alpha'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'Tat')

These results indicated that the arginine-rich domain of Tat was involved in the binding to IkappaB-alpha, which was consistent with previous observations (50,51).
('Tat', 'Binding', 'IkappaB-alpha')

Moreover, Tat associating with IkappaB-alpha competed the binding of IkappaB-alpha to p65 in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 3C, lanes 3-5), while Tat R(49-57)A, which lacked the binding site for IkappaB-alpha, did not associate with IkappaB-alpha and did not compete the binding of IkappaB-alpha to p65 (Figure 3C, lanes 6-8).
('Tat', 'Binding', 'IkappaB-alpha'),('Tat R(49-57)A', 'Binding', 'IkappaB-alpha'),('IkappaB-alpha', 'Binding', 'p65'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'Tat')

Next, we evaluated whether Tat counteracted the IkappaB-alpha-mediated inhibition of p65 binding to DNA by incubating in vitro translated p65 and IkappaB-alpha proteins with the NF-kappaB probe in presence or absence of Tat followed by EMSA.
('Tat', 'Binding', 'IkappaB-alpha'),('IkappaB-alpha', 'Binding', 'p65'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'Tat')

The p65 DNA binding activity was inhibited by IkappaB-alpha and restored in a dose-dependent manner by wild-type Tat, and not by Tat R(49-57) (Figure 3D).
('Tat', 'Binding', 'IkappaB-alpha'),('IkappaB-alpha', 'Binding', 'p65'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'Tat')

Further, we analysed the Tat effect on the IkappaB-alpha repression of p65 transcriptional activity by transfecting p50-/-p65-/-MEFs with the NF-kappaB-Luc reporter together with expression vectors of p65 and IkappaB-alpha, in presence or absence of Tat.
('Tat', 'Binding', 'IkappaB-alpha'),('IkappaB-alpha', 'Binding', 'p65'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'Tat')

IkappaB-alpha inhibited the p65-dependent expression of the luciferase gene, which was restored in a dose-dependent manner by wild-type Tat, and not by Tat R(49-57)A (Figure 3E).

Altogether these results indicated that Tat counteracts the IkappaB-alpha repression of the p65 DNA-binding and transcriptional activity by associating with IkappaB-alpha and competing the repressor binding to p65.

In both T cells and HeLa cells HIV-1 Tat suppressed the expression of Mn-dependent superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD), a mitochondrial enzyme that is part of the cellular defense system against oxidative stress.
('Tat', 'Transcription', 'Mn-SOD'),('Tat', 'Gene_expression', 'Mn-SOD')

Thus, Mn-SOD RNA protein levels and activity were markedly reduced in the presence of Tat.
('Tat', 'Transcription', 'Mn-SOD'),('Tat', 'Gene_expression', 'Mn-SOD')

A truncated Tat protein (Tat1-72), known to transactivate the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR), no longer affected Mn-SOD expression, the cellular redox state or TNF-mediated cytotoxicity.
('Tat', 'Transcription', 'Mn-SOD'),('Tat', 'Gene_expression', 'Mn-SOD')

Thus, our experiments demonstrate that the C-terminal region of HIV-1 Tat is required to suppress Mn-SOD expression and to induce pro-oxidative conditions reflected by a drop in reduced glutathione (GSH) and the GSH:oxidized GSH (GSSG) ratio.

('Tax', 'Localization', 'galectin-3'),('Tax', 'Transcription', 'galectin-3')

Analysis of various Tax mutants suggested that galectin-3 promoter induction is dependent on activation of the cyclic-AMP-responsive element binding protein/activation transcription factor family of transcription factors and, to a lesser extent, nuclear factor-kappa B/Rel induction.
('Tax', 'Localization', 'galectin-3'),('Tax', 'Transcription', 'galectin-3')

('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65'),('p65', 'Binding', 'p65')

We tested whether Tat physically interacted with p65.
('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65')

HeLa cells were transfected with the expression vectors of HA-p65 and FLAG-Tat, and 24 h later Tat was immunoprecipitated from cell extracts.
('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65')

The p65 protein was coimmunoprecipitated with wild-type Tat or the mutants Tat T,N(23,24)A, Tat K(50,51)A and Tat R(49-57)A at similar levels, while a significant decrease in coimmunoprecipitation was observed for Tat C(22,25,27)A (Figure 4A).
('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65'),('Tat C(22,25,27)A', 'Binding', 'p65')

Consistently, GST-pull down of in vitro translated proteins showed the direct binding of p65 to wild-type Tat, or the mutants Tat T,N(23,24)A, Tat K(50,51)A and Tat R(49-57)A, and lack of binding to Tat C(22,25,27)A (Figure 4B).
('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65'),('Tat C(22,25,27)A', 'Binding', 'p65')

These results indicated that Tat associated with p65 through the cysteine-rich domain and ruled-out the requirement of bridging proteins to mediate such interaction.
('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65')

To identify the p65 domain required for binding to Tat, HeLa cells were transfected with FLAG-Tat together with HA-p65 mutants, which were deleted of the transactivation domain [p65deltaC (1-318)], or the RHD [p65deltaN (122-551)] (Figure 4C).
('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65'),('p65', 'Binding', 'p65')

('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65'),('p65', 'Binding', 'p65')

To address the effect of Tat on the p65 DNA-binding affinity, purified recombinant p65 protein was incubated with 32P-labeled-NF-kappaB double-stranded oligonucleotide in presence or absence of wild-type Tat or Tat C(22,25,27)A, and p65 DNA-binding was analysed by EMSA.
('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65'),('Tat C(22,25,27)A', 'Binding', 'p65'),('p65', 'Binding', 'p65')

Whereas wild-type Tat significantly increased the binding of p65 to DNA, the mutant Tat C(22,25,27)A, lacking the binding site for p65, was ineffective (Figure 4E).
('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65'),('Tat C(22,25,27)A', 'Binding', 'p65'),('p65', 'Binding', 'p65')

We observed no genetic alterations in the IRF-4 promoter, which can account for the lack of IRF-4 expression: The detected base pair changes at position -1081 (T to C substitution), at position -1068 (A to C substitution) and at position -116 (A to C substitution) are unlikely responsible for absent IRF-4-expression since the first two mutations were found both in IRF-4-positive and -negative cells whereas the latter change was not detected consistently in all IRF-4-negative or -positive cells and may thus be a polymorphism.
('IRF-4', 'Binding', 'IRF-4'),('IRF-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'IRF-4')

Since IRF-4 expression in cell lines and CML can be induced by demethylation and successful IFN-alpha therapy (3), respectively, the existence of such genetic aberrations seems unlikely.

We then investigated whether the previously described down-regulation of IRF-4 expression in human myeloid leukemias was due to a differential hypermethylation of the promoter, since the presented re-expression due to AzadC-treatment might also be a result of activation of positive transcriptional regulators of IRF-4.
('IRF-4', 'Binding', 'IRF-4'),('IRF-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'IRF-4')

We found that IRF-4 expression could indeed be connected to the methylation status of distinct CpG motifs in the IRF-4 promoter.
('IRF-4', 'Binding', 'IRF-4'),('IRF-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'IRF-4')

At two further CpG sites (#48, 45) the methylation status in IRF-4-positive was lower than that of IRF-4-negative cells.
('IRF-4', 'Binding', 'IRF-4'),('IRF-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'IRF-4')

It has been shown that NFkappaB elements play an important role in IRF-4 induction as IRF-4 expression depends on binding of the transactivator c-Rel to these elements in the IRF-4 promoter (31,37).
('c-Rel', 'Gene_expression', 'IRF-4'),('IRF-4', 'Binding', 'IRF-4'),('IRF-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'IRF-4')

Via in vitro methylation and reporter gene assays we could clearly appoint the silencing of the IRF-4 promoter to a methylation effect, which may thus be the mechanism of IRF-4 deregulation in vivo.
('IRF-4', 'Binding', 'IRF-4'),('IRF-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'IRF-4')

The finding that IRF-4 expression is silenced by promoter hypermethylation might represent a mechanism that accounts for the previously observed loss of IRF-4 expression in CML.
('IRF-4', 'Binding', 'IRF-4'),('IRF-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'IRF-4')

Still, the obvious functional diversity of IRF-4 remains remarkable and cannot be fully explained by the IRF-4 promoter methylation status.
('IRF-4', 'Binding', 'IRF-4'),('IRF-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'IRF-4')

In multiple myeloma (MM) a translocation on chromosome 14q was reported to lead to a fusion gene of immunoglobulin heavy-chain (IgH) and IRF-4 resulting in a subsequent overexpression of IRF-4 (48,49).
('IRF-4', 'Binding', 'IRF-4'),('IRF-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'IRF-4')

Down-regulation of IRF-4 may promote leukemogenesis in myeloid cell context (3), which was recently confirmed in IRF-4-/- ICSBP-/- double knock-out mice (53), while IRF-4 up-regulation may induce a growth advantage in lymphomas or MM (48).
('IRF-4', 'Binding', 'IRF-4'),('IRF-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'IRF-4')

Taken together, our data suggest that IRF-4 promoter methylation regulates IRF-4 expression, and that aberrant expression of IRF-4 in certain types of leukemia may be a consequence of IRF-4 promoter hypermethylation.
('IRF-4', 'Binding', 'IRF-4'),('IRF-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'IRF-4')

Runx3-deficient T cells fail to silence CD4 expression normally (Fig.
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'CD4')

We therefore further fractionated the positively selected CD8+ T cells from Runx3 KO mice into CD8+CD4- SP or CD8+CD4+ DP cells by separation using anti-CD4 magnetic beads.
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'CD4')

This yielded a Runx3 KO SP "enriched" population that contained 75% CD8+CD4- cells and a KO DP enriched population that contained 85% CD8+CD4+ cells (Fig.
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'CD4')

As previously reported, TCR-induced proliferation of Runx3-/- CD8+ T cells was severely impaired, irrespective of CD4 expression (Fig.
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'CD4')

Although a fraction of the KO DP cells silenced CD4 expression after activation, the ratio of SP/DP cells in each enriched population remained constant thereafter, and we did not observe any major differences between these two populations throughout the culture period, indicating that in terms of effector CTL differentiation and under our culture conditions, Runx3-/- CD8+ T cells that also coexpress CD4 are indistinguishable from those that do not.
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'CD4')

The Transactivation Functions of HTLV-I Tax Are Suppressed by Foxp3
('Foxp3', 'Transcription', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

Since the HTLV-I Tax protein can function at multiple levels in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus to stimulate activation of NF-kappaB [28,29], we hypothesized that overexpression of Foxp3 may interfere with this process.
('Foxp3', 'Transcription', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

However, since Tax-dependent HTLV-I gene expression is independent of NF-kappaB [18], we also hypothesized that Foxp3 would not affect Tax-dependent activation of the HTLV-I LTR.
('Foxp3', 'Transcription', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

To test these hypotheses, we overexpressed HTLV-I Tax, full-length Foxp3, and/or deltaFKH in HEK 293T cells cotransfected with an HTLV-I LTR or NF-kappaB reporter vector.
('deltaFKH', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Transcription', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

Interestingly, overexpression of Foxp3, but not deltaFKH, suppressed Tax-mediated activation of NF-kappaB-dependent transcription.
('deltaFKH', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Transcription', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

These observations further suggest that the carboxyl-terminal FKH domain is required for inhibiting activation of NF-kappaB in the presence of Tax in HEK 293T cells, strikingly similar to the requirements of Foxp3 inhibition of basal NF-kappaB activation shown in Figure 2B.
('Foxp3', 'Transcription', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

Transactivation of the HTLV-I LTR was stimulated about 55-fold by overexpression of Tax (Figure 4B), while transfection of Foxp3 suppressed Tax-dependent HTLV-I LTR activation, although HTLV-I LTR activation in the presence or absence of Tax is independent of NF-kappaB or NF-AT (another transcriptional activator known to interact with Foxp3).
('Foxp3', 'Transcription', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

Furthermore, overexpression of deltaFKH also led to suppression of HTLV-I transactivation by Tax to a similar extent as full-length Foxp3 (Figure 4B).
('deltaFKH', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Transcription', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

The suppressive effects shown in Figure 4A and 4B were not the result of Foxp3 down-regulating the expression of the transfected Tax plasmid as determined by real-time RT-PCR (Figure 4C).
('Foxp3', 'Transcription', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

These results strongly suggest that Foxp3 interacts with transcriptional regulators in addition to NF-kappaB and NF-AT, and that the carboxyl-terminal FKH domain, and therefore localization to the nucleus, are not required for inhibition of Tax-mediated HTLV-I LTR activation (even in HEK 293T cells).
('Foxp3', 'Transcription', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

To determine whether Foxp3 inhibited the transactivation functions of Tax by directly associating with this viral protein, we generated an expression vector in which HTLV-I Tax was fused in-frame to the carboxyl terminus of the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (Gal4-BD).
('Foxp3', 'Transcription', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

Transactivation of the Gal4-resposive promoter by Gal4-BD-Tax remained relatively unaffected by overexpression of either EGFP (control), Foxp3, or deltaFKH, suggesting that Foxp3 does not repress Tax transactivation by directly interfacing with the HTLV-I Tax protein.
('deltaFKH', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Transcription', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

As illustrated in Figure 5, the level of Tax mRNA synthesized from ACH was down-regulated in the presence of Foxp3 compared to the level produced in the presence of the control vector.
('Foxp3', 'Transcription', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

deltaFKH did not have a discernable affect on Tax expression.
('deltaFKH', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

These data indicate that Foxp3 is capable of repressing the expression of Tax from an infectious HTLV-I molecular clone.

The gp160-induced NF-kappa B complex consists of p65, p50 and c-rel proteins.

The latter has evolved a mechanism to counteract A3G activity by expressing the regulatory protein Vif (4).
('Vif', 'Negative_regulation', 'A3G'),('Vif', 'Protein_catabolism', 'A3G')

Vif induces proteasomal degradation of A3G and additionally inhibits A3G activity by further mechanisms (8, 37-43).
('Vif', 'Negative_regulation', 'A3G'),('Vif', 'Protein_catabolism', 'A3G')

To investigate whether the overexpression of HIV-1 proteins also influences A3G promoter activity, we either expressed HIV-1 Vif or the HIV-1 Tat protein, the latter has been shown to activate different viral and cellular promoters (44,45).
('Vif', 'Negative_regulation', 'A3G'),('Vif', 'Protein_catabolism', 'A3G')

Luciferase assays showed that the transcriptional activity of the A3G promoter was not significantly altered in the presence of Vif, Tat or HIV-1NL4-3 (Figure 4A), suggesting that HIV-1 is not modulating A3G expression on the transcriptional level.
('Vif', 'Negative_regulation', 'A3G'),('Vif', 'Protein_catabolism', 'A3G')

Deletion analysis of the carboxyl-terminal region of Stat6 and recombination of this region with a heterologous DNA binding domain allowed the delimitation and characterization of the transactivation domain of Stat6.
('Stat6', 'Regulation', 'Stat6')

IL-4 activates gene expression by inducing tyrosine phosphorylation, homodimerization, and nuclear translocation of the latent transcription factor, STAT6 (signal transducer and activator of transcription-6).
('IL-4', 'Phosphorylation', 'STAT6'),('IL-4', 'Localization', 'STAT6'),('IL-4', 'Binding', 'STAT6')

STAT6-responsive elements are characteristically present in the promoters of IL-4-inducible genes.
('IL-4', 'Phosphorylation', 'STAT6'),('IL-4', 'Localization', 'STAT6'),('IL-4', 'Binding', 'STAT6')

Because STAT6 activation is essential for IL-4-induced gene expression, we examined the ability of type I and type II IFNs to regulate activation of STAT6 by IL-4 in primary human monocytes.
('IL-4', 'Phosphorylation', 'STAT6'),('IL-4', 'Localization', 'STAT6'),('IL-4', 'Binding', 'STAT6')

Pretreatment of monocytes with IFN-beta or IFN-gamma, but not IL-1, IL-2, macrophage colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor, IL-6, or transforming growth factor beta suppressed activation of STAT6 by IL-4.
('IFN-gamma', 'Positive_regulation', 'STAT6'),('IL-1', 'Positive_regulation', 'STAT6'),('transforming growth factor beta', 'Positive_regulation', 'STAT6'),('IL-4', 'Phosphorylation', 'STAT6'),('IL-6', 'Positive_regulation', 'STAT6'),('IL-4', 'Localization', 'STAT6'),('IL-4', 'Binding', 'STAT6'),('IFN-beta', 'Positive_regulation', 'STAT6'),('IL-2', 'Positive_regulation', 'STAT6')

This inhibition was associated with decreased tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT6 and was not evident unless the cells were preincubated with IFN for at least 1 hr before IL-4 stimulation.
('IL-4', 'Phosphorylation', 'STAT6'),('IL-4', 'Localization', 'STAT6'),('IL-4', 'Binding', 'STAT6')

These findings demonstrate that IFNs inhibit IL-4-induced activation of STAT6 and STAT6-dependent gene expression, at least in part, by inducing expression of SOCS-1.
('IL-4', 'Phosphorylation', 'STAT6'),('IL-4', 'Localization', 'STAT6'),('IL-4', 'Binding', 'STAT6')

Although three sites in the TNF-alpha promoter (kappa 1, kappa 2, and kappa 3) specifically bind the transcription factor NF-kappa B in lymphoid nuclear extracts, TNF-alpha mRNA induction by PMA does not correlate with NF-kappa B binding activities displayed by different T and B cell lines.
('TNF-alpha', 'Positive_regulation', 'TNF-alpha')

STAT1 activity was evident on the STAT binding sequences (SBE) present in the promoters of genes which are up-regulated during monocyte to macrophage maturation such as FcgammaRI and ICAM-1, and in the promoter of the transcription factor IFN regulatory factor-1.
('STAT1', 'Gene_expression', 'ICAM-1'),('STAT1', 'Gene_expression', 'FcgammaRI')

Taken together these results indicate that STAT1 plays a pivotal role in the differentiation/maturation process of monocytes as an early transcription factor initially activated by adherence and then able to modulate the expression of functional genes, such as ICAM-1 and FcgammaRI.
('STAT1', 'Gene_expression', 'ICAM-1'),('STAT1', 'Gene_expression', 'FcgammaRI')

In our previous study, we demonstrated a major positive regulatory role for GATA-1 and a negative regulatory role for GATA-2 in MBP gene transcription.
('GATA-1', 'Transcription', 'MBP'),('GATA-2', 'Transcription', 'MBP')

Furthermore, we have demonstrated that both C/EBPbeta and GATA-1 can bind simultaneously to the C/EBP- and GATA-binding sites in the MBP promoter.
('GATA-1', 'Transcription', 'MBP')

To determine the functionality of both the C/EBP- and GATA- binding sites, we analyzed whether C/EBPbeta and GATA-1 can stimulate the MBP promoter in the C/EBPbeta and GATA-1 negative Jurkat T-cell line.
('GATA-1', 'Transcription', 'MBP')

Expression of FOG (riend ATA), which binds to GATA-1 and acts as a cofactor for GATA-binding proteins, decreased transactivation activity of GATA-1 for the MBP promoter in a dose-dependent manner.
('GATA-1', 'Transcription', 'MBP')

However, stimulated SHARPIN-deficient BMDC had reduced transcription and secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators IL6, IL12P70, GMCSF, and nitric oxide.

We previously showed that the TRAF family member TRAF2 mediates recruitment of HOIL-1L-interacting protein (HOIP) to the cytoplasmic domain of CD40, suggesting that HOIP has a role in the CD40 signaling pathway.
('TRAF2', 'Binding', 'HOIL-1L-interacting protein')

We found that the CD40-induced upregulation of CD80 and activation of germline immunoglobulin epsilon transcription were defective in HOIP-deficient cells.
('CD40', 'Positive_regulation', 'CD80')

IL-4, a product of the T-helper 0 (Th0) and 2 (Th2) subset, was originally described as a B-cell stimulatory factor and has subsequently been found to suppress IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-alpha gene expression in monocytes stimulated with LPS, and to upregulate IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL1-RA) gene expression.
('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', '(IL1-RA'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-8'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-1 beta'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'TNF-alpha')

('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-8'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-1 beta'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'TNF-alpha')

IL-4 also suppressed the IL-2-induced IL-6 mRNA expression.
('IL-2', 'Transcription', 'IL-6')

IL-4 did not exert significant influence on the induction of expression of IL-1-RA or various CSFs by IL-2, IL-3, and GM-CSF.

Enhanced IL-2 transcription correlates with increased c-fos synthesis and increased Fos content of AP-1.
('c-fos', 'Transcription', 'IL-2')

We therefore examined the effects of EC on T cell nuclear factors known to regulate IL-2 transcription, including c-jun and c-fos-two components of the transcription factor AP-1, NFAT, and others.

TNF is the major inducer of NF-kappaB and particularly of the p50-p65 complex, whereas IL-7 acts as a cofactor by sustaining the expression of the p75 TNF receptor.

Additionally, we aimed to define a regulatory role for the C-terminal tail of RPS3 whose function was unknown.Here we show that the Inhibitor of kappaB (IkappaB) kinase beta (IKKbeta) phosphorylated RPS3 at serine 209 (S209).
('RPS3', 'Binding', 'RPS3')

To address the mechanisms regulating IL-10 production by Th1 cells invivo, we transferred DO11.10 cells into BALB/c recipient mice and immunized the recipients with very high doses of OVA-protein with or without added lipopolysacharide (LPS).
('OVA', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

This invivo immunization induced IL-10 and IFN-gamma production, and the amount of IL-10 production was enhanced by addition of LPS in the immunization (Figure3A) and with higher doses of OVA (3 muM versus 1 muM, data not shown).
('OVA', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

To test the role of STAT4 and STAT6 signaling in the invivo development of IL-10-producing Th1 cells, we transferred STAT4- or STAT6-deficient or WT DO11.10 cells into recipient BALB/c mice and immunized with OVA-protein plus LPS as before.

GATA3 Represses the FOXP3 Promoter
('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

To investigate the molecular mechanism of GATA3-mediated repression of human FOXP3, the human FOXP3 promoter was studied and a palindromic binding site for GATA3 was discovered.
('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('FOXP3', 'Regulation', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

We transfected human primary CD4+ T cells, in vitro differentiated Th2 cells, and Jurkat cells (Jurkat cells are known to constitutively express GATA3 [25,26]), and we measured FOXP3 promoter activity.
('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

Overexpression of GATA3 in naive T cells diminished luciferase activity of the FOXP3 promoter compared with the control vector (Figure 8B).
('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

This mutation increased luciferase activity by 3-fold in memory CD4+CD45RO+ T cells, whereas no difference was observed in naive (GATA3-) CD4+CD45RA+ T cells, revealing a repressor activity of GATA3 on the FOXP3 promoter (Figure 8C).
('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

Furthermore GATA3 binds directly to the FOXP3 promoter as investigated by pull-down assay.
('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

HEK cells were transiently transfected with GATA3 or a control vector, and increasing amounts of lysates were incubated with oligonucleotides containing the GATA3 site of the FOXP3 promoter or a control oligonucleotide with a mutated GATA3-binding site.
('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

These experiments demonstrated that GATA3 binds the palindromic FOXP3 promoter.
('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

To gain insights into the in vivo situation, we performed a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) using an anti-GATA3 antibody and showed that GATA3 binds to the FOXP3 promoter region in Th2 cells, but not in iTreg cells (Figure 7F).
('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

Taken together these data demonstrate that the GATA3-binding to the FOXP3 promoter is repressing FOXP3 expression.

Runx3-deficient T cells fail to silence CD4 expression normally (Fig.
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'CD4')

We therefore further fractionated the positively selected CD8+ T cells from Runx3 KO mice into CD8+CD4- SP or CD8+CD4+ DP cells by separation using anti-CD4 magnetic beads.
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'CD4')

This yielded a Runx3 KO SP "enriched" population that contained 75% CD8+CD4- cells and a KO DP enriched population that contained 85% CD8+CD4+ cells (Fig.
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'CD4')

As previously reported, TCR-induced proliferation of Runx3-/- CD8+ T cells was severely impaired, irrespective of CD4 expression (Fig.
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'CD4')

Although a fraction of the KO DP cells silenced CD4 expression after activation, the ratio of SP/DP cells in each enriched population remained constant thereafter, and we did not observe any major differences between these two populations throughout the culture period, indicating that in terms of effector CTL differentiation and under our culture conditions, Runx3-/- CD8+ T cells that also coexpress CD4 are indistinguishable from those that do not.
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'CD4')

This study demonstrates that RUNX transcription factors 1 and 3 play an important role in the generation of FOXP3+ iT reg cells by TGF-beta.
('RUNX', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'RUNX'),('TGF-beta', 'Transcription', 'RUNX'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

TGF-beta mediates RUNX induction and FOXP3 is efficiently up-regulated by RUNX1 and RUNX3 in human CD4+ T cells.
('RUNX', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'RUNX'),('TGF-beta', 'Transcription', 'RUNX'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

There are three putative RUNX binding sites in the proximal FOXP3 promoter.
('RUNX', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

The RUNX protein that actually induces the expression of FOXP3 might therefore be dependent on the availability of the specific RUNX family member at certain stages of T cell development.
('RUNX', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

It was shown that TGF-beta is mandatory for the maintenance of peripheral T reg cells and their expression of Foxp3 (Marie et al., 2005; Rubtsov and Rudensky, 2007).
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3')

RUNX transcription factors are targets of the TGF-beta superfamily and they are involved in the TGF-beta pathway.
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'RUNX'),('TGF-beta', 'Transcription', 'RUNX')

TGF-beta can activate RUNX genes at the transcriptional level, and at the posttranscriptional level through activation or stabilization of RUNX proteins (Jin et al., 2004).
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'RUNX'),('TGF-beta', 'Transcription', 'RUNX')

It was shown that RUNX2 regulates the expression of TGF-beta type I receptor (Ji et al., 2001), suggesting that other mechanisms for their function could be involved.
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'RUNX'),('TGF-beta', 'Transcription', 'RUNX'),('RUNX2', 'Gene_expression', 'TGF-beta type I receptor')

('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'RUNX'),('TGF-beta', 'Transcription', 'RUNX')

RUNX3 plays an important role in TGF-beta-mediated growth control in epithelial cells, as loss of RUNX3 leads to decreased sensitivity to TGF-beta and hyperproliferation of the gastric mucosa (Blyth et al., 2005).
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'RUNX'),('TGF-beta', 'Transcription', 'RUNX')

We observed that single siRNA interference of either RUNX1 or RUNX3 alone shows a slight decrease in Foxp3+ T reg cell induction, which could be caused by redundancy of these proteins.
('RUNX1', 'Positive_regulation', 'Foxp3'),('RUNX3', 'Positive_regulation', 'Foxp3')

Foxp3 induction by TGF-beta is reduced in CD4+ T cells of CbfbF/F CD4-cre mice compared with CbfbF/+ CD4-cre mice.
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3'),('Cbfb', 'Negative_regulation', 'Foxp3')

We observed an increased number of Foxp3+ cells by retinoic acid and TGF-beta compared with TGF-beta treatment alone in CbfbF/+ CD4-cre mice and CbfbF/F CD4-cre mice.
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3'),('Cbfb', 'Negative_regulation', 'Foxp3')

These data in mice confirm the human data that RUNX proteins play an important role for TGF-beta-dependent FOXP3 induction, as well as in the suppressive capacity of iT reg cells.
('RUNX', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'RUNX'),('TGF-beta', 'Transcription', 'RUNX'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

As an additional support for this concept, the overexpression of RUNX1 induced increased FOXP3 protein expression without any requirement of TGF-beta and anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 stimulation in human primary CD4+ cells.
('RUNX', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'RUNX'),('TGF-beta', 'Transcription', 'RUNX'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

Cbfb-deficient nT reg cells progressively lose Foxp3 upon division, and there is no evidence of increased death of Cbfb-deficient nT reg cells in that study.
('Cbfb', 'Negative_regulation', 'Foxp3')

The experiments in Cbfb-deficient CD4-cre T cells in mice and the knockdown experiments in humans in this study suggest that the induction of Foxp3 expression is a major contributing factor in the in vivo conversion experiment.
('Cbfb', 'Negative_regulation', 'Foxp3')

Whether the diminished capacity of Cbfb-deficient CD4-cre T cells in the generation of Foxp3 may be caused by peripheral expansion of Cbfb-deficient non-T reg cells or survival problems faced by Cbfb-deficient iT reg cells after Foxp3 induction remains to be elucidated.
('Cbfb', 'Negative_regulation', 'Foxp3'),('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'Foxp3')

Runx3/Cbfbeta are both required for the activation of the Ifng gene and silencing of the Il4 gene in Th1 cells (Djuretic et al., 2007; Naoe et al., 2007).
('Cbfbeta', 'Negative_regulation', 'Il4'),('Cbfbeta', 'Positive_regulation', 'Ifng'),('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'Ifng'),('Runx3', 'Negative_regulation', 'Il4')

Furthermore, it was shown that Runx1 activates IL-2 and IFN-gamma gene expression in conventional CD4+ T cells by binding to their respective promoter.
('Runx1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2'),('Runx1', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma')

RUNX1 interacts physically with Foxp3 protein, and it was demonstrated that this interaction might be responsible for the suppression of IL-2 and IFN-gamma production and up-regulation of T reg cell-associated molecules (Ono et al., 2007).
('RUNX1', 'Positive_regulation', 'Foxp3')

Specifically, Foxp3 physically interacts with RORgammat, and this interaction inhibits RORgammat function (Zhou et al., 2008).
('Foxp3', 'Negative_regulation', 'RORgammat')

This relationship of RORgammat and Foxp3 and probably yet unknown mechanisms might be the basis of the observation that the differentiation of Th17 cells and T reg cells is often reciprocal (Bettelli et al., 2006).
('Foxp3', 'Negative_regulation', 'RORgammat')

Recently, data suggests that Runx1 may also be involved in regulating Il17 transcription, functioning in complex with RORgammat to activate transcription (Zhang et al., 2008).
('Runx1', 'Transcription', 'Il17')

We have shown a link between Foxp3 induction in iT reg cells and RUNX1 and RUNX3.
('RUNX1', 'Positive_regulation', 'Foxp3'),('RUNX3', 'Positive_regulation', 'Foxp3')

RUNX proteins play a central role in pathways regulating cell growth and differentiation, and their interaction with the TGF-beta pathway is of particular interest.

NFAT forms a complex with AP-1 and NF-kappaB and regulates the expression of IL-2, IL-4, IFN-gamma, and CTLA4 in conventional T cells, which leads to the activation and differentiation to effector T cells (Dolganov et al., 1996; Hu et al., 2007).
('AP-1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2'),('AP-1', 'Gene_expression', 'CTLA4'),('AP-1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-4'),('AP-1', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma')

The NFAT-AP-1 complex also binds to the Foxp3 promoter after TCR triggering and regulates its gene expression positively (Mantel et al., 2006).
('AP-1', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3')

It was shown that NFAT and Smad3 cooperate to induce Foxp3 expression through its enhancer (Tone et al., 2008), but no TGF-beta response element was identified in the Foxp3 gene or in the surrounding regions.
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3'),('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'Foxp3'),('Smad3', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3')

The initial induction of RUNX1 and RUNX3 and the subsequent binding of these transcription factors to the Foxp3 promoter that we showed here might explain the relatively late induction of Foxp3 mRNA that peaks 24-48 h after stimulation.
('RUNX1', 'Positive_regulation', 'Foxp3'),('RUNX3', 'Positive_regulation', 'Foxp3'),('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'Foxp3')

Similar to this interaction, NFAT may also cooperate with RUNX1 or RUNX3 to activate Foxp3, but further studies are necessary to elaborate on this concept.
('RUNX1', 'Positive_regulation', 'Foxp3'),('RUNX3', 'Positive_regulation', 'Foxp3')

The induction of the transcription factors RUNX1 and RUNX3 by TGF-beta and the subsequent up-regulation of Foxp3 play a role in iT reg cell generation and its suppressive capacity.

IL-10 Production by Th2 and Th17 Cells Also Requires ERK1 and ERK2 Activation
('ERK2', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('ERK1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

To address whether IL-10 production by Th2 and Th17 cells was also dependent on ERK1 and ERK2 activation, we differentiated these cells with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 in the absence of APCs (Shoemaker etal., 2006; Veldhoen etal., 2009; Veldhoen etal., 2006), in the presence or absence of the MEK inhibitor (PD184352).
('ERK2', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('ERK1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('MEK', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

We showed that ERK1 and ERK2 activation is a common pathway required for induction of IL-10 in different Th cell subsets because IL-10 production by both Th2 and Th17 cells was markedly inhibited in the presence of the MEK inhibitor (PD184352) (Figure5D and FigureS5B).
('ERK2', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('ERK1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('MEK', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Activation of the ERK1 and ERK2 signaling pathway is therefore a common requirement for the induction of IL-10 production by Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells.
('ERK2', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('ERK1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

The activity of the promoter regulating the synthesis of the p105 precursor of the NF-kappa B p50 subunit was enhanced in these cells.
('p50', 'Positive_regulation', 'p105')

These observations indicate that during chronic HIV infection of U937 cells, continuous NF-kappa B (p50/p65) translocation results in p105 promoter upregulation with subsequent cytosolic NF-kappa B accumulation, ready for further translocation.

The Th2-type cytokines, interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13), induce expression of a distinct subset of genes in human monocytes, including FcepsilonRIIb (CD23), 15-lipoxygenase, IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), and type I and type II IL-1 receptors (IL-1R).

Involvement of Egr-1/RelA synergy in distinguishing T cell activation from tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced NF-kappa B1 transcription.
('Egr-1', 'Gene_expression', 'NF-kappa B1'),('Egr-1', 'Positive_regulation', 'NF-kappa B1'),('tumor necrosis factor-alpha', 'Transcription', 'NF-kappa B1'),('Egr-1', 'Positive_regulation', 'RelA')

In this manuscript we have investigated the molecular mechanisms by which T cell lines stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and phytohemagglutin (PHA) display significantly higher levels of NF-kappa B1 encoding transcripts than cells stimulated with tumor necrosis factor-alpha, despite the fact that both stimuli activate NF-kappa B.
('PHA', 'Transcription', 'NF-kappa B1'),('tumor necrosis factor-alpha', 'Transcription', 'NF-kappa B1')

Characterization of the NF-kappa B1 promoter identified an Egr-1 site which was found to be essential for both the PMA/PHA-mediated induction as well as the synergistic activation observed after the expression of the RelA subunit of NF-kappa B and Egr-1.
('PHA', 'Transcription', 'NF-kappa B1'),('Egr-1', 'Gene_expression', 'NF-kappa B1'),('Egr-1', 'Positive_regulation', 'NF-kappa B1'),('Egr-1', 'Positive_regulation', 'RelA')

Furthermore, Egr-1 induction was required for endogenous NF-kappa B1 gene expression, since PMA/PHA-stimulated T cell lines expressing antisense Egr-1 RNA were inhibited in their ability to upregulate NF-kappa B1 transcription.
('PHA', 'Transcription', 'NF-kappa B1'),('Egr-1', 'Gene_expression', 'NF-kappa B1'),('Egr-1', 'Positive_regulation', 'NF-kappa B1')

Our studies indicate that transcriptional synergy mediated by activation of both Egr-1 and NF-kappa B may have important ramifications in T cell development by upregulating NF-kappa B1 gene expression.
('Egr-1', 'Gene_expression', 'NF-kappa B1'),('Egr-1', 'Positive_regulation', 'NF-kappa B1')

We also found that IL-2 protects T cell clones from IL-2 deprivation apoptosis accompanying active proliferation and enhanced expression of P53, Rb and Bcl-xL proteins.

Compared with monocytes in suspension or adherent on plastic surfaces, monocytes adherent to fibronectin or RGD exhibited a greater than threefold increase in steady state levels of IFN-gamma-induced mRNA for the high affinity Fc gammaRI receptor.

Runx3 controls multiple aspects of the CTL differentiation program, in part through induction of Eomes
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'Eomes'),('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'Eomes')

Strikingly, Runx3-/- CD8+ T cells were strongly impaired in their ability to differentiate into effector CTLs, as judged by expression of perforin, granzyme B, and IFN-gamma (Fig.
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'granzyme B'),('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'granzyme B'),('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'perforin')

Compared with WT T cells, perforin mRNA and protein expression were essentially undetectable in Runx3-/- T cells at day 6 of culture (Fig.
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'perforin')

Runx3-/- T cells also had no detectable Eomes expression; in contrast, T-bet expression was unimpaired (Fig.
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'Eomes'),('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'Eomes')

Furthermore, Runx3 was required for maximal production of IFN-gamma, but not TNF or IL-2, by CD8+ T cells restimulated at day 6 (Fig.
('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'TNF')

We previously reported that Th1 cell differentiation was regulated through a feed-forward loop in which T-bet is up-regulated early and induces Runx3, after which T-bet and Runx3 cooperate to induce IFN-gamma and silence IL-4, thus promoting stable differentiation toward the Th1 lineage (15, 22).
('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma')

Because (a) Runx3 appeared necessary for Eomes induction (Fig.
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'Eomes'),('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'Eomes')

3 A), (b) the kinetics of Eomes expression paralleled those of perforin expression (Fig.
('Eomes', 'Transcription', 'perforin'),('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin')

2), and (c) overexpression of Eo-VP16 in either WT or T-bet-deficient T cells led to an increase in both perforin and IFN-gamma expression (Fig.
('Eo-VP16', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin')

Specifically, we asked whether Runx3, which was necessary for Eomes induction, then cooperated with Eomes to regulate transcription of the effector CTL markers perforin, IFN-gamma, and granzyme B.
('Eomes', 'Transcription', 'IFN-gamma'),('Eomes', 'Transcription', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'granzyme B'),('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'Eomes'),('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'Eomes'),('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'granzyme B'),('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'granzyme B'),('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'perforin'),('Eomes', 'Transcription', 'granzyme B')

To test this hypothesis, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays to ask whether Eomes and Runx3 bound regulatory regions of the Prf1, Ifng, and Gzmb genes (Fig.
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'Eomes'),('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'Eomes')

Runx3 bound to the Prf1 and Gzmb transcription start sites (TSS); to a known IL-2 responsive enhancer located near -1 kb of the Prf1 gene (23); to the distal CTL-specific DNase I hypersensitive site 9 in the Prf1 locus (24); to the Ifng promoter near the TSS, as previously reported for Th1 cells (10); and to several DNase I hypersensitive sites in the Ifng locus (Fig.
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2')

To determine whether Runx3 controlled the expression of CTL effector genes through its induction of Eomes, we retrovirally expressed Runx3 and Eo-VP16 in CD8+ T cells from Runx3-/- mice.
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'Eomes'),('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'Eomes')

Reconstitution of Runx3-/- CD8+ T cells with Runx3 restored expression of Eomes as well as perforin, granzyme B, and IFN-gamma (Fig.
('Eomes', 'Transcription', 'IFN-gamma'),('Eomes', 'Transcription', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'granzyme B'),('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'Eomes'),('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'Eomes'),('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'granzyme B'),('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'granzyme B'),('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'perforin'),('Eomes', 'Transcription', 'granzyme B')

Notably, Eo-VP16 did not up-regulate perforin expression when expressed in Runx3-/- cells, even though it restored the capacity to induce IFN-gamma expression upon TCR restimulation (Fig.
('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'IFN-gamma'),('Eo-VP16', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'perforin')

This result suggests strongly that perforin expression requires Runx3 and Eomes.

As expected from their defect in perforin and granzyme B expression, Runx3-/- CD8+ T cells showed defective cytolytic activity in a mixed lymphocyte reaction (12).
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'granzyme B'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'granzyme B'),('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'perforin')

Therefore, although activation of the perforin/granzyme B machinery is defective in Runx3-/- CD8+ cells, these cells are not entirely devoid of cytolytic activity and could still effectively kill targets, possibly by alternative mechanisms such as the Fas-Fas ligand pathway.

The Effect of Corticosteroids on GATA-3 Nuclear Translocation and IL-4 mRNA
('GATA-3', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-4')

Corticosteroids are effective in inhibiting GATA-3-regulated IL-4 gene expression in vitro and in vivo [32].
('GATA-3', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-4')

This effect was concentration- and time-dependent, with a peak effect of 11.6-fold at 30 min at a concentration of 10-8 M (Figure 1C) and was associated with marked reductions in anti-CD3/CD28-stimulated IL-4 and IL-5 mRNA expression (Figure 1D) and a loss of GATA-3 binding to the native IL-5 promoter (Figure 1E).
('GATA-3', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-4')

Transcription factor GATA-3 is differentially expressed in murine Th1 and Th2 cells and controls Th2-specific expression of the interleukin-5 gene.
('GATA-3', 'Gene_expression', 'interleukin-5')

We previously established a critical role for the transcription factor GATA-3 in IL-5 promoter activation in EL-4 cells, which express both Th1- and Th2-type cytokines.
('GATA-3', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-5'),('GATA-3', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-5')

Our studies reported here demonstrate that GATA-3 is critical for expression of the IL-5 gene in bona fide Th2 cells.
('GATA-3', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-5'),('GATA-3', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-5')

Whereas mutations in the GATA-3 site abolished antigen- or cAMP- stimulated IL-5 promoter activation in Th2 cells, ectopic expression of GATA-3 in Th1 cells or in a non-lymphoid, non-IL-5-producing cell line activated the IL-5 promoter.

To address the mechanisms regulating IL-10 production by Th1 cells in vivo, we transferred DO11.10 cells into BALB/c recipient mice and immunized the recipients with very high doses of OVA-protein with or without added lipopolysacharide (LPS).
('OVA', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

This in vivo immunization induced IL-10 and IFN-gamma production, and the amount of IL-10 production was enhanced by addition of LPS in the immunization (Figure 3A) and with higher doses of OVA (3 muM versus 1 muM, data not shown).
('OVA', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

To test the role of STAT4 and STAT6 signaling in the in vivo development of IL-10-producing Th1 cells, we transferred STAT4- or STAT6-deficient or WT DO11.10 cells into recipient BALB/c mice and immunized with OVA-protein plus LPS as before.

I kappa B/MAD-3 masks the nuclear localization signal of NF-kappa B p65 and requires the transactivation domain to inhibit NF-kappa B p65 DNA binding.
('MAD-3', 'Localization', 'p65'),('MAD-3', 'Binding', 'p65'),('p65', 'Localization', 'p65'),('p65', 'Binding', 'p65')

To investigate the molecular basis for the critical regulatory interaction between NF-kappa B and I kappa B/MAD-3, a series of human NF-kappa B p65 mutants was identified that functionally segregated DNA binding, I kappa B-mediated inhibition, and I kappa B-induced nuclear exclusion of this transcription factor.
('MAD-3', 'Localization', 'p65'),('MAD-3', 'Binding', 'p65')

Results from in vivo expression studies performed with these NF-kappa B p65 mutants revealed the following: 1) I kappa B/MAD-3 completely inhibits NF-kappa B p65-dependent transcriptional activation mediated through the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 kappa B enhancer in human T lymphocytes, 2) the binding of I kappa B/MAD-3 to NF-kappa B p65 is sufficient to retarget NF-kappa B p65 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, 3) selective deletion of the functional nuclear localization signal present in the Rel homology domain of NF-kappa B p65 disrupts its ability to engage I kappa B/MAD-3, and 4) the unique C-terminus of NF-kappa B p65 attenuates its own nuclear localization and contains sequences that are required for I kappa B-mediated inhibition of NF-kappa B p65 DNA binding activity.
('MAD-3', 'Localization', 'p65'),('MAD-3', 'Binding', 'p65'),('p65', 'Localization', 'p65'),('p65', 'Binding', 'p65')

Together, these findings suggest that the nuclear localization signal and transactivation domain of NF-kappa B p65 constitute a bipartite system that is critically involved in the inhibitory function of I kappa B/MAD-3.
('MAD-3', 'Localization', 'p65'),('MAD-3', 'Binding', 'p65')

Unexpectedly, our in vivo studies also demonstrate that I kappa B/MAD-3 binds directly to NF-kappa B p50.

Runx3 and perforin mRNA are expressed by double-positive (DP) thymocytes and CD8+single-positive (SP) thymocytes but not in CD4+SP cells (14).
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin')

T-bet is induced quickly upon TCR stimulation and is required for early programming of cytokine production (17), whereas Eomes is induced later during differentiation and sustains IFN-gamma expression.
('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma')

Runx3 is required for Eomes and perforin expression, and both Eomes and Runx3 bind at thePrf1locus; in contrast, perforin expression is unaffected in T-bet-deficient cells.
('Eomes', 'Transcription', 'Prf1'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'Eomes'),('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin')

T cells lacking Runx3 show decreased expression of IFN-gamma and granzyme B, and Runx3 also binds the promoter regions of theIfngandGzmbgenes.
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'granzyme B'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'Gzmb')

Collectively, these results provide evidence for a complex transcriptional network in which Runx3 is a primary regulator ofGzmbexpression but synergizes with T-bet and Eomes, respectively, to promote transcription of theIfngandPrf1genes.

The nuclear pool of I(kappa)B(alpha) showed a higher stability than cytosolic I(kappa)B(alpha) and was partially independent of the resynthesis of the protein.
('I(kappa)B(alpha)', 'Gene_expression', 'I(kappa)B(alpha)')

Unexpectedly, the presence of nuclear I(kappa)B(alpha) did not inhibit NF-kappaB binding to DNA and this phenomenon was not due to the presence of IkappaBbeta at the nuclear level.
('IkappaBbeta', 'Localization', 'I(kappa)B(alpha)')

We propose that the activation of an NFAT kinase by PDTC could be responsible for the rapid shuttling of the NFAT, therefore transiently converting the sustained transactivation of this transcription factor that occurs during lymphocyte activation, and show that c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) can act by directly phosphorylating NFATp.

Although GM-CSF does not appear to be essential for normal hemopoiesis, overexpression of GM-CSF has been implicated in the pathogenesis of some diseases such as myeloid leukemia and chronic inflammation.

Role of Egr-2 in up-regulation of Fas ligand in normal T cells and aberrant double-negative lpr and gld T cells.
('Egr-2', 'Positive_regulation', 'Fas ligand')

We previously identified a Fas ligand regulatory element (FLRE) in the Fas ligand (fasL) promoter that binds Egr family proteins and demonstrated that Egr-3 (PILOT) but not Egr-1 (NGFI-A, Krox-24, Tis-8, and Zif-268) induces transcription of fasL.
('PILOT', 'Transcription', 'fasL'),('Egr-1', 'Transcription', 'fasL')

Although overexpressed Egr-1 was ineffective, overexpressed Egr-2 was as potent as Egr-3 in inducing fasL promoter-dependent reporter constructs in T cell hybridomas and HeLa cells, and both up-regulated endogenous fasL mRNA in HeLa cells.
('Egr-1', 'Transcription', 'fasL')

Thus, Egr-2, in addition to Egr-3, regulates FasL expression in activated normal T cells, and Egr-2 is likely to play a direct role in aberrant fasL up-regulation in lpr/lpr and gld/gld CD4(-)CD8(-) T cells.

By increasing GATA-1 levels via co-transfection, we were able to transactivate the hEpoR promoter in K562 cells and non-erythroid cells, but not in the highly active OCIM1 cells, although GATA-1 mRNA levels were comparable in OCIM1 and K562.
('GATA-1', 'Gene_expression', 'hEpoR'),('GATA-1', 'Positive_regulation', 'hEpoR')

Interestingly, when we mutated the Sp1 site, resulting in a marked decrease in hEpoR promoter activity, we could restore transactivation by increasing GATA-1 levels in OCIM1 cells.
('GATA-1', 'Gene_expression', 'hEpoR'),('GATA-1', 'Positive_regulation', 'hEpoR')

These data suggest that while GATA-1 can transactivate the EpoR promoter, the level of hEpoR gene expression does not depend on GATA-1 alone.
('GATA-1', 'Gene_expression', 'hEpoR'),('GATA-1', 'Positive_regulation', 'hEpoR')

Rather, hEpoR transcription activity depends on coordination between Sp1 and GATA-1 with other cell-specific factors, including possibly other Sp1-like binding proteins, to provide high level, tissue-specific expression.

3.5 microg of the FOXP3 promoter luciferase reporter vector or a combination together with the RUNX1, RUNX3 pEGFPN1 vector, and 0.5 microg phRL-TK were added to 3 x 106 CD4+ T cells resuspended in 100 microl of Nucleofector solution (Lonza) and electroporated using the program U-15.

To understand the function of AML1 during B cell differentiation, we analyzed regulatory regions of B cell-specific genes for potential AML1-binding sites and have identified a putative AML1-binding site in the promoter of the B cell-specific tyrosine kinase gene, blk.
('AML1', 'Regulation', 'blk'),('AML1', 'Transcription', 'blk')

Gel mobility shift assays and transient transfection assays demonstrate that AML1 binds specifically to this site in the blk promoter and this binding site is important for blk promoter activity.

BSAP has been shown previously to be important for B cell-specific regulation of the blk gene.

TNFalpha treatment induces a rapid translocation of the 65 kD transcriptional activator NF-kappaB subunit, Rel A, whose binding in the nucleus occurs before changes in intracellular ROS.
('TNFalpha', 'Localization', 'Rel A')

Here we show that in E29.1 T cell hybridoma I kappa B alpha and I kappa B beta are equally associated with p65 and that I kappa B beta is degraded in response to TNF alpha in contrast to what has been originally published.
('TNF alpha', 'Protein_catabolism', 'I kappa B beta')

A kappa B-site was identified in the promoter of the intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) gene, which is involved in regulation of ICAM-1 expression by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and glucocorticoids.
('TNF-alpha', 'Gene_expression', 'ICAM-1'),('TNF-alpha', 'Transcription', 'ICAM-1')

In monocytic THP-1 cells TNF-alpha induced two nuclear complexes which in vitro bound to the ICAM-1 kappa B site.
('TNF-alpha', 'Gene_expression', 'ICAM-1'),('TNF-alpha', 'Transcription', 'ICAM-1')

We argue that in vivo RelA homodimers are likely to play a dominant role in TNF-alpha-induced ICAM-1 transcription in monocytic cells.

Model of MIP-1alpha transcriptional activation by HIV-1 Tat.
('Tat', 'Transcription', 'MIP-1alpha'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'MIP-1alpha'),('Tat', 'Gene_expression', 'MIP-1alpha')

(A) In absence of Tat, IkappaB-alpha occupies the NF-kappaB enhancer of the MIP-1alpha promoter and likely interacts with transcriptional repressors, such as HDACs (65), to inhibit gene transcription.
('Tat', 'Transcription', 'MIP-1alpha'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'MIP-1alpha'),('Tat', 'Gene_expression', 'MIP-1alpha')

(B) Tat activates the MIP-1alpha expression by removing the IkappaB-alpha repressor from the NF-kappaB enhancer, and by increasing the binding of p65 NF-kappaB complex to the NF-kappaB enhancer.

To investigate the inhibitory mechanisms, we constructed a secreted-type placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP) reporter gene whose transcription is controlled by a 1.4-kb human TNF-alpha promoter.
('TNF-alpha', 'Transcription', 'placental alkaline phosphatase')

The functional interaction between Foxp3 and CREB did not affect the DNA-binding activity of CREB-1, but did show a modest decrease in activating transcription factor 2 (ATF-2) DNA-binding activity in the presence of forskolin as determined by transcription factor ELISA (Figure 7B).
('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'activating transcription factor 2'),('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'CREB-1')

To determine whether Foxp3 can disrupt the function/recruitment of the coactivator protein p300, we introduced a Gal4 reporter vector and a Gal4-BD-CREB-1 expression vector into HEK 293T cells in the absence or presence of Foxp3, p300, and/or control expression vectors (Figure 7C).
('p300', 'Transcription', 'Gal4-BD-CREB-1'),('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'CREB-1'),('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'p300'),('p300', 'Binding', 'p300'),('Foxp3', 'Positive_regulation', 'Gal4-BD-CREB-1')

As expected, p300 overexpression stimulated transcription of the Gal4-BD-CREB-1 fusion protein.
('p300', 'Transcription', 'Gal4-BD-CREB-1')

Foxp3, again, repressed basal levels of Gal4-BD-CREB-1 activation by more than 2-fold, while effectively neutralizing Gal4-BD-CREB-1 activation in the presence of p300.
('p300', 'Transcription', 'Gal4-BD-CREB-1'),('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'CREB-1'),('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'p300'),('Foxp3', 'Positive_regulation', 'Gal4-BD-CREB-1')

Overexpression of Foxp3 failed to reduce the detectable levels of CREB phosphorylation using a phosphospecific antibody for CREB-1 (unpublished data).
('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'CREB-1')

However, when we attempted to determine whether Foxp3 could physically interact with the coactivator protein p300, we found that p300 immunoprecipitated Foxp3 when both proteins were overexpressed in HEK 293T cells (Figure 7D).
('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'p300'),('p300', 'Binding', 'p300')

Collectively, these results suggest that Foxp3 antagonizes CREB-dependent gene expression by directly interacting with coactivator p300 and interfering with its function and/or recruitment to CREB-responsive promoter sequences.
('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'p300')

LMP1 Upregulates IL10 and Constitutively Activates Stat3
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL10'),('IL10', 'Positive_regulation', 'Stat3')

Transcription of IL10, IL15, and IFNgamma were reproducibly detected in LMP1 transgenic lymphocytes and lymphoma cells and was higher than in the B cell lymphoma cell lines 967 and K46mu (Figure 5A).
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL10'),('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'IFNgamma'),('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL15')

There was no significant difference in the expression of IL15 and IFNgamma between LMP1 transgenic lymphocytes and lymphoma cells, suggesting that upregulation of IL15 and IFNgamma is induced by LMP1 expression in healthy lymphocytes but is not a unique property of malignant lymphocytes.
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'IFNgamma'),('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL15')

Strikingly, IL10, a B lymphocyte stimulatory cytokine, was increased 1.5- to 5-fold in the wild-type and LMP1 transgenic lymphoma cells compared to LMP1 transgenic lymphocytes (Figure 5A).
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL10')

Immunoblot analysis indicated that LMP1 transgenic lymphocytes and wild-type and LMP1 transgenic lymphoma cells had corresponding increased levels of phosphorylated alpha and beta isoforms of activated Stat3, a target of the IL10 receptor (Figure 5B).
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL10'),('IL10', 'Positive_regulation', 'Stat3')

However, when comparing the same lymphomas, there was no correlation between the levels of IL10 induction and the levels of Stat3 activation.
('IL10', 'Positive_regulation', 'Stat3')

This suggests that the activation of Stat3 is not solely induced by IL10 or that Stat3 activation may be constitutive.
('IL10', 'Positive_regulation', 'Stat3')

Additionally, there was no correlation between the levels of LMP1 expression and the levels of IL10 induction (Figures 1A and 5A).
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL10')

This indicates that the induction of IL10 is a general property associated with enhanced survival and may only be indirectly affected by LMP1.
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL10')

Neutralizing antibodies to IL10 did not affect the survival of lymphoma cells as determined by the MTS assay (unpublished data), suggesting constitutive activation of Stat3.
('IL10', 'Positive_regulation', 'Stat3')

This was confirmed by immunoblot analysis such that in the presence of anti-IL10 neutralizing antibodies, pStat3 levels remained activated in lymphoma cells isolated from wild-type and LMP1 transgenic lymphomas (Figure 5C).
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL10'),('IL10', 'Positive_regulation', 'pStat3'),('IL10', 'Positive_regulation', 'Stat3')

Exogenous addition of IL10 enhanced pStat3 activation above constitutive levels, indicating that lymphoma cells are responsive to IL10 treatment (Figure 5C).
('IL10', 'Positive_regulation', 'pStat3'),('IL10', 'Positive_regulation', 'Stat3')

This means that although the lymphoma cells have constitutive Stat3 activation, it may be further enhanced by IL10 induction.
('IL10', 'Positive_regulation', 'Stat3')

Nuclear translocation of pStat3 is a consequence of activation, and nuclear pStat3 was not detected by immunohistochemistry staining of spleen sections from control mice.
('pStat3', 'Localization', 'pStat3')

Retinoblastoma protein expression leads to reduced Oct-1 DNA binding activity and enhances interleukin-8 expression.
('Retinoblastoma', 'Gene_expression', 'interleukin-8'),('Retinoblastoma', 'Binding', 'Oct-1')

Oct-1, a POU domain transcription factor, was identified as a repressor of HLA-DRA promoter activity in the Rb-defective cells.
('Rb', 'Phosphorylation', 'Oct-1')

Rb expression led to phosphorylation of Oct-1, thus relieving its repressive effect.
('Rb', 'Phosphorylation', 'Oct-1')

Consistent with reduced levels of Oct-1 DNA binding activity in the Rb-transformed cell lines, interleukin 8 expression is higher in these cell lines.
('Rb', 'Phosphorylation', 'Oct-1')

Two allelic, autosomal recessive mutations in the Sharpin gene occurred spontaneously in two inbred strains of mice, C57B/KaLawRij-Sharpincpdm/Sharpincpdm and CBy.Ocb3/Dem-Sharpincpdm-Dem/Sharpincpdm-Dem, resulting in premature termination of mRNA synthesis and absence of a functional protein product [2].
('Sharpin', 'Negative_regulation', 'Sharpin')

There are accumulations of eosinophils, neutrophils and macrophages in the skin of Sharpincpdm/Sharpincpdm mutant mice (hereafter referred to as cpdm mice) associated with increased expression of Th2 cytokines in the skin and in the supernatants of activated splenocytes [5].
('Sharpin', 'Negative_regulation', 'Sharpin')

A low amount of transcription of Ifngamma was induced by IL-12 when cells were differentiated with low antigen dose, but this effect of IL-12 was markedly upregulated with increasing doses of antigen (Figure 6A).
('IL-12', 'Transcription', 'Ifngamma'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'Ifngamma')

However, IL-12 induced a high amount of Il10 transcription as well as Ifngamma expression with increased antigen doses (Figure 6A), again in keeping with the protein data (Figure 1A).
('IL-12', 'Transcription', 'Ifngamma'),('IL-12', 'Transcription', 'Il10'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'Ifngamma')

In contrast, high amounts of GATA-3 mRNA expression were only observed under Th2 cell differentiation conditions (low-dose antigen) (Figure 6B), and this expression was markedly downregulated by both increasing antigen dose and coculture in IL-12 (Figure 6B).
('IL-12', 'Transcription', 'GATA-3')

Interestingly, IL-12 sustained the high expression of c-Maf mRNA even at the highest antigen dose (Figure 6B).
('IL-12', 'Transcription', 'c-Maf')

Moreover, IL-12 maintenance of c-maf expression required STAT4 activation (data not shown).
('c-maf', 'Positive_regulation', 'STAT4'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'c-maf')

We showed also that like Il10 expression, c-maf expression was inhibited in Th1 and Th17 cells in the presence of the MEK1 and MEK2 inhibitor (PD184352), whereas T-bet and RORgammat expression was hardly affected (Figure 6D).

Effect of IL-4 on FOXP3 Induction

(D) Intracellular GATA3 and FOXP3 staining are shown after exposure of CD4+CD45RA+ T cells to IL-4 as described for panel B.
('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

In contrast, protein kinase C stimulation or RelA overexpression does not affect the activity of a human IL4 promoter containing a mouse P sequence, which is a higher-affinity site for NF-ATp and a lower-affinity site for RelA.
('RelA', 'Binding', 'NF-ATp'),('NF-ATp', 'Binding', 'RelA')

Thus, competition between two general transcriptional activators, RelA and NF-ATp, mediates the inhibitory effect of protein kinase C stimulation on IL4 expression and may contribute to differential gene expression in TH cells.

Regulation of FOXP3 promoter activity and FOXP3 protein expression by RUNX1 and RUNX3
('RUNX3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

To investigate the effect of RUNX1 and RUNX3 binding to the RUNX binding sites in the FOXP3 promoter, we transfected human peripheral blood CD4+ T cells with a FOXP3 promoter luciferase reporter vector and RUNX1 or RUNX3 expression vectors.
('RUNX3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

An increase in luciferase activity was observed only when the FOXP3 promoter (-511 to +176) luciferase construct was cotransfected with RUNX1 or RUNX3 expression vectors (Fig.
('RUNX3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

In these experiments, the overexpression of RUNX1 and RUNX3 eliminated the need of TGF-beta for FOXP3 promoter activation and PMA/ionomycin stimulation was sufficient.
('RUNX3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

To examine the role of each of the three RUNX binding sites for the FOXP3 promoter activity, we mutated each individually or in combination.
('RUNX', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

4 B), suggesting that the identified binding sites have redundant functions and RUNX binding to more than one site is necessary for the full activation of the FOXP3 promoter.
('RUNX', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

Supporting these findings, the overexpression of RUNX1 in human primary CD4+ T cells resulted in significantly elevated levels of FOXP3 protein measured by flow cytometry after 48 h. This was achieved without any requirement for anti-CD3, anti-CD28 stimulation, or the presence of TGF-beta.
('RUNX1', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

Although there was a trend, the transfection of CD4+ T cells with RUNX3 did not lead to statistically significant increase in FOXP3 (Fig.
('RUNX3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

Perforin and granzyme B expression are not appreciably regulated by T-bet
('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'granzyme B'),('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'Perforin')

To test the model outlined in the previous paragraph directly, we compared the expression of IFN-gamma, perforin, and granzyme B in CD8+ T cells from WT and Tbx21 (T-bet)-deficient mice.
('T-bet', 'Transcription', 'perforin'),('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'granzyme B'),('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma')

In contrast, T-bet-deficient T cells cultured for 6 d showed no defect in perforin mRNA expression (Fig.
('T-bet', 'Transcription', 'perforin')

We consistently observed a modest reduction in GzmB mRNA in T-bet-deficient T cells (Fig.
('T-bet', 'Transcription', 'GzmB'),('T-bet', 'Negative_regulation', 'GzmB')

Eo-VP16, but not the empty GFP retrovirus, increased perforin expression in both WT and T-bet-deficient CD8+ T cells (Fig.
('T-bet', 'Transcription', 'perforin'),('Eo-VP16', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin')

As expected, Eo-VP16 also rescued the early defect in IFN-gamma production observed in T-bet-deficient CD8+ T cells (Fig.
('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma')

However, Eo-VP16 did not induce GzmB mRNA expression in either WT or T-bet-deficient cells; thus, the partial T-bet dependence of GzmB mRNA expression cannot be compensated for by Eo-VP16.
('T-bet', 'Transcription', 'GzmB'),('Eo-VP16', 'Transcription', 'GzmB'),('T-bet', 'Negative_regulation', 'GzmB')

Mutation of the NF-kappaB site did not affect IL-2 expression, whereas mutation of the AP-1 site or PKC depletion almost revoked IL-2 release.
('IL-2', 'Localization', 'IL-2'),('IL-2', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2')

The KBF1 factor, which binds to the enhancer A located in the promoter of the mouse MHC class I gene H-2Kb, is indistinguishable from the p50 DNA binding subunit of the transcription factor NF-kappa B, which regulates a series of genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses.
('p50', 'Binding', 'KBF1')

The KBF1/p50 factor binds as a homodimer but can also form heterodimers with the products of other members of the same family, like the c-rel and v-rel (proto)oncogenes.
('p50', 'Binding', 'c-'),('p50', 'Binding', 'KBF1'),('p50', 'Binding', 'v-rel')

The dimerization domain of KBF1/p50 is contained between amino acids 201 and 367.
('p50', 'Binding', 'KBF1')

A mutant of KBF1/p50 (delta SP), unable to bind to DNA but able to form homo- or heterodimers, has been constructed.
('p50', 'Binding', 'KBF1')

This protein reduces or abolishes in vitro the DNA binding activity of wild-type proteins of the same family (KBF1/p50, c- and v-rel).

Evidence for suppressed activity of the transcription factor NFAT1 at its proximal binding element P0 in the IL-4 promoter associated with enhanced IL-4 gene transcription in T cells of atopic patients.
('NFAT1', 'Regulation', 'IL-4')

Allergen-specific T cells in atopic patients are polarized IL-4-producing Th2 cells, promoting IgE synthesis by B cells.
('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'IgE')

IL-4 gene regulation in general involves the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) family of transcription factors, of which NFAT1 and NFAT2 are most prominent in peripheral T cells.
('NFAT2', 'Regulation', 'IL-4'),('NFAT1', 'Regulation', 'IL-4')

Recently, a unique inhibitory role of NFAT1 in IL-4 gene control was shown in the mouse.
('NFAT1', 'Regulation', 'IL-4')

These findings suggest that high-level IL-4 production in atopic Th2 cells is associated with selective reduction of suppressive NFAT1 activity at the IL-4 P0 element and that some patients with this multifactorial disease may have a putative systemic disorder at this level.
('NFAT1', 'Regulation', 'IL-4')

To circumvent this problem, we developed an alternative procedure which allowed us to show that in neutrophils, LPS and TNFalpha induce a NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity which essentially consists of p50/RelA dimers, and that IFNgamma promotes the binding of STAT1 homodimers to the IFNgamma response region of the FcgammaRI promoter.
('IFNgamma', 'Binding', 'STAT1')

GATA-1 and erythropoietin cooperate to promote erythroid cell survival by regulating bcl-xL expression.
('GATA-1', 'Gene_expression', 'bcl-xL'),('erythropoietin', 'Gene_expression', 'bcl-xL')

Here we report that in erythroid cells, GATA-1 strongly induces the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein bcl-xL, but not the related proteins bcl-2 and mcl-1.
('GATA-1', 'Gene_expression', 'bcl-2'),('GATA-1', 'Gene_expression', 'mcl-1'),('GATA-1', 'Gene_expression', 'bcl-xL')

Consistent with a role for bcl-xL in mediating GATA-1-induced erythroid cell survival, in vitro-differentiated bcl-xL-/- embryonic stem cells fail to generate viable mature definitive erythroid cells, a phenotype resembling that of GATA-1 gene disruption.
('GATA-1', 'Gene_expression', 'bcl-xL')

In addition, we show that erythropoietin, which is also required for erythroid cell survival, cooperates with GATA-1 to stimulate bcl-xL gene expression and to maintain erythroid cell viability during terminal maturation.
('GATA-1', 'Gene_expression', 'bcl-xL'),('erythropoietin', 'Gene_expression', 'bcl-xL')

Together, our data show that bcl-xL is essential for normal erythroid development and suggest a regulatory hierarchy in which bcl-xL is a critical downstream effector of GATA-1 and erythropoietin-mediated signals.
('GATA-1', 'Gene_expression', 'bcl-xL'),('erythropoietin', 'Gene_expression', 'bcl-xL')

Cross-linking CD19 on early human B lineage cells induces the formation of a CD19/Vav/phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase complex, tyrosine phosphorylation of CD19 and Vav, and activation of the Ras pathway.
('CD19', 'Binding', 'CD19'),('CD19', 'Phosphorylation', 'CD19')

To further explore the ramifications of CD19 signaling, the current study examined whether phosphorylation of Elk-1, activation of activator protein-1 (AP-1), or activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) transcription factors occurred following CD19 cross-linking.

The present study demonstrates that tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced degradation of I kappa B alpha in human T cells is preceded by its rapid phosphorylation in vivo.
('tumor necrosis factor alpha', 'Protein_catabolism', 'I kappa B alpha')

Subsequent studies have revealed that (i) cytoplasmic RelA is stably associated not only with I kappa B alpha but also with other ankyrin motif-rich proteins including the products of the NF-kappa B2 (p100) and NF-kappa B1 (p105) genes; (ii) in contrast to RelA-I kappa B alpha, RelA-p100 cytoplasmic complexes are not dissociated following tumor necrosis factor alpha activation; (iii) p100 functions as a potent inhibitor of RelA-mediated transcription in vivo; (iv) the interaction of RelA and p100 involves the conserved Rel homology domain of both proteins but not the nuclear localization signal of RelA, which is required for I kappa B alpha binding; (v) p100 inhibition of RelA function requires the C-terminal ankyrin motif domain, which mediates cytoplasmic retention of RelA; and (vi) as observed with I kappa B alpha, nuclear RelA stimulates p100 mRNA and protein expression.

The participation of STAT4 in the regulation of IRF-1 was demonstrated in two ways.

First, STAT4 was required for the IL-12-dependent transactivation of an IRF-1 reporter construct, and second, STAT4 binding to the IRF-1 promoter was shown using EMSA.
('STAT4', 'Regulation', 'IRF-1')

In contrast to IL-12, no up-regulation of IRF-1 was found in IL-4-stimulated cells, and IL-4 did not block IL-12-dependent up-regulation of IRF-1.

Stat3gamma is derived from Stat3alpha by limited proteolysis and lacks the carboxyl-terminal portion of Stat3alpha.
('Stat3alpha', 'Positive_regulation', 'Stat3gamma')

Because this region of Stat3alpha is involved in transcriptional activation, our findings suggest the possibility that Stat3gamma may be transcriptionally inactive and may compete with Stat3alpha for Stat3 binding sites in these terminally differentiated myeloid cells.

Treatment of T cells with the selective PKC inhibitor GF109203X abrogates the PMA-induced IkB alpha phosphorylation/degradation irrespective of activation of Ca(2+)-dependent pathways, but not the phosphorylation and degradation of IkB alpha induced by TNF-alpha, a PKC-independent stimulus.
('TNF-alpha', 'Phosphorylation', 'IkB alpha'),('TNF-alpha', 'Protein_catabolism', 'IkB alpha')

Triggering of complement receptors CR1 (CD35) and CR3 (CD11b/CD18) induces nuclear translocation of NF-kappa B (p50/p65) in human monocytes and enhances viral replication in HIV-infected monocytic cells.

('CD2', 'Phosphorylation', 'HS1'),('CD28', 'Phosphorylation', 'HS1')

We have examined changes in HS1 phosphorylation after differential stimulation of CD3, CD2, and CD28 to elucidate its role in T cells and to further delineate the signaling pathways recruited by these receptors.
('CD2', 'Phosphorylation', 'HS1'),('CD28', 'Phosphorylation', 'HS1')

Unlike ligation of CD3, stimulation with anti-CD28 mAb or CHO cells expressing the CD28 ligands CD80 or CD86 did not lead to tyrosine phosphorylation of HS1 in Jurkat T cells.
('CD2', 'Phosphorylation', 'HS1'),('CD28', 'Phosphorylation', 'HS1')

Additionally, no tyrosine phosphorylation of HS1 was induced by mitogenic pairs of anti-CD2 mAbs capable of activating the transcription factor NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells).
('CD2', 'Phosphorylation', 'HS1')

Costimulation through CD28 and/or CD2 did not modulate the CD3-dependent phosphorylation of HS1.
('CD2', 'Phosphorylation', 'HS1'),('CD28', 'Phosphorylation', 'HS1')

Thus, although CD3, CD28, and CD2 activate many of the same signaling molecules, they differed in their capacity to induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of HSI.

During Epstein-Barr virus latent infection of B lymphocytes in vitro, six viral nuclear antigens (EBNAs) are expressed from one of two promoters, Cp or Wp, whose activities are mutually exclusive.
('Cp', 'Positive_regulation', 'Wp')

Upon infection, Wp is initially active, followed by a switch to Cp for the duration of latency.
('Cp', 'Positive_regulation', 'Wp')

It was determined that oriP, the origin for episomal maintenance during latency, is essential for efficient transcription initiation from either Cp or Wp in LCLs, as well as in some Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines.
('Cp', 'Positive_regulation', 'Wp')

In general, deletions which diminished Cp activity resulted in induction of Wp activity, consistent with suppression of Wp activity by transcriptional interference from Cp.
('Cp', 'Positive_regulation', 'Wp')

Furthermore, our studies showed association of the IKK-alpha/beta heterodimer with NIK, IkappaB-alpha and -epsilon in unstimulated cells.
('NIK', 'Phosphorylation', 'IkappaB-alpha')

Exposure to LPS or TNF led to differential patterns of IkappaB-alpha and IkappaB-epsilon disappearance from and reassembly with the signalsome, whereas IKK-alpha, IKK-beta, and NIK remained complex-associated.
('NIK', 'Phosphorylation', 'IkappaB-alpha')

NIK cannot phosphorylate IkappaB-alpha directly, but it appears to be a functionally important subunit, because mutated NIK inhibited stimulus-induced kappaB-dependent transcription more effectively than mutated IKK-alpha or -beta.
('NIK', 'Phosphorylation', 'IkappaB-alpha')

IL-2 gene expression and NF-kappa B activation through CD28 requires reactive oxygen production by 5-lipoxygenase.
('CD28', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2')

Activation of the CD28 surface receptor provides a major costimulatory signal for T cell activation resulting in enhanced production of interleukin-2 (IL-2) and cell proliferation.
('CD28', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2')

In primary T lymphocytes we show that CD28 ligation leads to the rapid intracellular formation of reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs) which are required for CD28-mediated activation of the NF-kappa B/CD28-responsive complex and IL-2 expression.
('CD28', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2')

The small heat shock protein HSP27 has recently been proposed as a PKD1 substrate [24] and we accordingly assessed whether PKD-null DT40 cells have defective phosphorylation of HSP27 on serine 82, the proposed PKD1 substrate sequence.
('PKD1', 'Phosphorylation', 'HSP27')

We initially investigated the regulation of HSP27 phosphorylation in single knockout DT40 B cells lacking either PKD1 or PKD3.
('PKD1', 'Phosphorylation', 'HSP27'),('PKD3', 'Phosphorylation', 'HSP27')

BCR and phorbol ester signals were also able to increase HSP27 phosphorylation in PKD1 or PKD3 single knockout DT40 B cells (Fig.
('PKD1', 'Phosphorylation', 'HSP27'),('PKD3', 'Phosphorylation', 'HSP27')

However, BCR- and phorbol ester-induced phosphorylation of HSP27 on S82 was abolished in B cells that lacked both PKD1 and PKD3 (Fig.
('PKD1', 'Phosphorylation', 'HSP27'),('PKD3', 'Phosphorylation', 'HSP27')

Significantly, doxycycline-induced expression of the Flag-PKD3 transgene in the double knockout cells was sufficient to restore normal regulation of HSP27 phosphorylation (Fig.
('PKD3', 'Phosphorylation', 'HSP27')

In contrast, expression of a kinase-deficient PKD3 mutant protein in the double knockout cells was not able to restore BCR- or phorbol ester-induced HSP27 phosphorylation (Fig.
('PKD3', 'Phosphorylation', 'HSP27')

Hence, PKD3 as well as PKD1 can regulate HSP27 phosphorylation and in DT40 B cells they are functionally redundant as HSP27 kinases.
('PKD1', 'Phosphorylation', 'HSP27'),('PKD3', 'Phosphorylation', 'HSP27')

A dimerization cofactor of HNF-1 alpha (DCoH) was identified that displayed a restricted tissue distribution and did not bind to DNA, but, rather, selectively stabilized HNF-1 alpha dimers.
('DCoH', 'Binding', 'HNF-1 alpha')

The formation of a stable tetrameric DCoH-HNF-1 alpha complex, which required the dimerization domain of HNF-1 alpha, did not change the DNA binding characteristics of HNF-1 alpha, but enhanced its transcriptional activity.
('DCoH', 'Binding', 'HNF-1 alpha')

IKKbeta is required for RPS3 nuclear translocation
('IKKbeta', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

To examine whether the RPS3-IKKbeta interaction is required for RPS3 nuclear translocation, we knocked down IKKalpha or IKKbeta expression with siRNAs (Supplementary Fig.
('IKKbeta', 'Localization', 'RPS3'),('RPS3', 'Localization', 'RPS3'),('IKKalpha', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

RPS3 nuclear translocation was only slightly, if at all, impaired by IKKalpha-silencing.
('IKKalpha', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

Conversely, knockdown of IKKbeta attenuated 60-70% of RPS3 nuclear accumulation following stimulation (Fig.
('IKKbeta', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

Immunoblotting of nuclear fractions confirmed that full expression of IKKbeta, but not IKKalpha, was necessary for activation-induced RPS3 nuclear translocation (Fig.
('IKKbeta', 'Localization', 'RPS3'),('IKKalpha', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

We next examined the nuclear translocation of RPS3 in cells ectopically expressing either kinase-dead (SSAA) or constitutively-active (SSEE) mutant IKKbeta proteins.
('IKKbeta', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

As expected, the SSEE, but not SSAA, mutant of IKKbeta induced NF-kappaB-dependent luciferase reporter activity (Fig.
('IKKbeta', 'Regulation', 'luciferase')

Whereas RPS3 remained cytosolic in IKKbeta (SSAA)-expressing cells (Fig.
('IKKbeta', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

2c, right), a substantial proportion of RPS3 translocated to the nucleus in cells expressing IKKbeta (SSEE) (Fig.
('IKKbeta', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

The percentage of cells containing detectable nuclear RPS3 increased 5-fold in IKKbeta (SSEE)-expressing cells, but not in IKKbeta (SSAA)-expressing ones (Fig.
('IKKbeta', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

Thus, IKKbeta activity is necessary and sufficient for RPS3 nuclear translocation in response to NF-kappaB activating stimuli.
('IKKbeta', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

In combination, EBF and E47 induce efficient expression of the endogenous immunoglobulin surrogate light chain genes, lambda5 and VpreB, whereas other pre-B cell-specific genes remain silent.
('E47', 'Gene_expression', 'lambda5'),('EBF', 'Gene_expression', 'VpreB'),('E47', 'Gene_expression', 'VpreB'),('EBF', 'Gene_expression', 'lambda5')

Multiple functionally important EBF and E47 binding sites were identified in the lambda5 promoter/enhancer region, indicating that lambda5 is a direct genetic target for these transcription factors.
('E47', 'Gene_expression', 'lambda5'),('EBF', 'Gene_expression', 'lambda5')

Expression of the IgG Fc receptor type I (Fc gamma RI) on myeloid cells is dramatically increased by treatment with interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma).
('IFN-gamma', 'Transcription', 'Fc gamma RI')

We observed that Fc gamma RI transcript levels in monoblast-like U937 cells were elevated within 3 hr and peaked 12 hr after exposure to IFN-gamma.
('IFN-gamma', 'Transcription', 'Fc gamma RI')

Treatment of U937 with IFN-gamma for 9 hr in the presence of cycloheximide led to super-induction of Fc gamma RI expression.
('IFN-gamma', 'Transcription', 'Fc gamma RI')

Nuclear run-on analysis revealed that the rate of Fc gamma RI transcription was increased by IFN-gamma.
('IFN-gamma', 'Transcription', 'Fc gamma RI')

Transient transfections of CAT reporter gene constructs containing various Fc gamma RIC promoter sequences into U937 cells revealed that a 20-bp region surrounding the transcription start site (-7 to +13) was capable of mediating transcription initiation and that an IFN-gamma responsive element (GIRE) was present within 74 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site.
('IFN-gamma', 'Transcription', 'Fc gamma RI')

Gel shift experiments further showed that the STAT1 alpha protein bound to the Fc gamma RIC GIRE in response to IFN-gamma treatment of U937 cells.
('IFN-gamma', 'Transcription', 'Fc gamma RI'),('STAT1 alpha', 'Regulation', 'Fc gamma RIC')

The Fc gamma RIC GIRE is homologous to the IFN-gamma activation sequence (GAS) of the guanylate binding protein and to X box elements of class II MHC genes.
('IFN-gamma', 'Transcription', 'Fc gamma RI')

Our results demonstrate that transcriptional regulation of the Fc gamma RIC gene by IFN-gamma involves the binding of STAT1 alpha to a 17-bp GAS homology in the proximal promoter.
('IFN-gamma', 'Transcription', 'Fc gamma RI'),('STAT1 alpha', 'Regulation', 'Fc gamma RIC')

Steel factor affects SCL expression during normal erythroid differentiation.
('Steel factor', 'Gene_expression', 'SCL'),('Steel factor', 'Transcription', 'SCL')

Steel factor is one of the growth factors that controls the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic cells and SCL, also known as Tcl-5 or Tal-1, is a transcription factor involved in erythropoiesis.
('Steel factor', 'Gene_expression', 'SCL'),('Steel factor', 'Transcription', 'SCL')

In this report, we studied the role of SCL in the proliferation of human peripheral blood burst-forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E) and the effects of Steel factor on SCL expression in proliferating erythroid cells.
('Steel factor', 'Gene_expression', 'SCL'),('Steel factor', 'Transcription', 'SCL')

The role of SCL in Steel factor-induced erythroid proliferation was then examined.
('Steel factor', 'Gene_expression', 'SCL'),('Steel factor', 'Transcription', 'SCL')

In day 7 and day 10 erythroid precursors cultured with Steel factor, SCL protein was increased significantly compared to control.
('Steel factor', 'Gene_expression', 'SCL'),('Steel factor', 'Transcription', 'SCL')

The increase in SCL protein levels in early erythroid precursors stimulated with Steel factor suggests one mechanism through which Steel factor may enhance normal erythroid proliferation.
('Steel factor', 'Gene_expression', 'SCL'),('Steel factor', 'Transcription', 'SCL')

SCL mRNA levels assessed by Northern blot in day 7 cells did not increase significantly in response to Steel factor stimulation, suggesting that posttranscriptional mechanisms may also be important in the increase in SCL protein observed in response to Steel.
('Steel factor', 'Gene_expression', 'SCL'),('Steel factor', 'Transcription', 'SCL')

In addition, we observed that the A3G promoter was not inducible by IFN-alpha or IFN-gamma in A3.01 T cells, whereas in the hepatic cell line HepG2, a moderate induction was measured.
('IFN-alpha', 'Gene_expression', 'A3G'),('IFN-gamma', 'Gene_expression', 'A3G')

A recent study found no influence of IFN-alpha or IFN-gamma on A3G expression in resting primary blood lymphocytes (52).
('IFN-alpha', 'Gene_expression', 'A3G'),('IFN-gamma', 'Gene_expression', 'A3G')

Another publication describes an enhanced expression of A3G after IFN-alpha treatment in resting primary CD4 T cells, but not in activated T cells (53).
('IFN-alpha', 'Gene_expression', 'A3G')

The HIV-1 Vif protein is neutralizing the antiviral function of A3G by a multitude of ways.
('Vif', 'Protein_catabolism', 'A3G'),('Vif', 'Transcription', 'A3G')

There is evidence that Vif also promotes exclusion of A3G from the virus particles and an influence on the A3G translation process is discussed (8,42,43).
('A3G', 'Binding', 'A3G'),('A3G', 'Transcription', 'A3G'),('Vif', 'Protein_catabolism', 'A3G'),('Vif', 'Transcription', 'A3G')

The question whether Vif alters transcription controlled by the A3G promoter has not been analyzed so far.
('Vif', 'Protein_catabolism', 'A3G'),('Vif', 'Transcription', 'A3G')

Our analysis indicates that transcription from the A3G promoter is unaffected by Vif or other HIV-1 proteins.
('Vif', 'Protein_catabolism', 'A3G'),('Vif', 'Transcription', 'A3G')

This observation is consistent with the results of the 5'-RACE, since Sp1 is known to play an important role for RNA polymerase II to bind to the transcription initiation site in TATA-boxless promoters and is associated with multiple transcription initiation sites (54-56).
('Sp1', 'Binding', 'RNA polymerase II')

Therefore, Sp1/Sp3 transcription factors are most likely also mediating basal transcription of the A3F gene.
('Sp1', 'Transcription', 'A3F'),('Sp3', 'Transcription', 'A3F')

Nuclear factor of activated T cells and AP-1 are insufficient for IL-2 promoter activation: requirement for CD28 up-regulation of RE/AP.
('CD28', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-2')

IL-2 promoter activation in Jurkat T cells stimulated with superantigen presented by Raji B cells requires CD28 activation.
('CD28', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-2')

The addition of rCTLA4Ig, which blocks CD28 binding to its ligand, to the cultures decreased IL-2 promoter activation by >80%.
('CD28', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-2')

Thus, the requirement for CD28 in IL-2 promoter activation appears to be due to RE/AP and not the NFAT or AP-1 sites.
('CD28', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-2')

Thus, c-Fos/c-Jun heterodimers might contribute to the repression of DRA gene expression.

BMP-6 induces phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8
('BMP-6', 'Phosphorylation', 'Smad1'),('BMP-6', 'Phosphorylation', '5'),('BMP-6', 'Phosphorylation', '8')

Interestingly, treatment with 500 ng/ml BMP-6 induced phosphorylation of Smad.
('BMP-6', 'Phosphorylation', '5')

The BMP-6 induced phosphorylation was high at the earliest time point tested (15 minutes), and remained high for at least 48 hours (Figure 5).
('BMP-6', 'Phosphorylation', '5'),('BMP-6', 'Phosphorylation', '8')

However, we did not observe any significant changes in the level of phospho-STAT3 or phospho-p38 upon BMP-6 treatment of B cells (data not shown).

The current study provides evidence that GATA3 and FOXP3 play a competitive role in iTreg cell commitment as T-bet and GATA3 for Th1 and Th2 differentiation, respectively.
('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

We show that GATA3 inhibits FOXP3 induction and that IL-4 limits FOXP3 expression in a GATA3-mediated way, both in vitro and in vivo.
('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

We also show that GATA3 directly binds to the FOXP3 promoter and thereby prevents the induction of this gene, demonstrating that Th2 differentiation overrules iTreg induction.
('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

Stimulation of T cells with BW 828 induced an increase in intracellular Ca2+, but did not lead to detectable activation of the protein kinases p56(lck) and c-Raf-1.
('BW 828', 'Positive_regulation', 'p56(lck)')

On the other hand, stimulation of T cells with mAb 9.3 increased the level of intracellular Ca2+ and triggered the activation of p56(lck) and c-Raf-1, but was unable to induce the binding of transcription factors to the IL-2 promoter.
('9.3', 'Positive_regulation', 'p56(lck)')

In contrast to the differential signaling of BW 828 and 9.3 in resting T cells, the two mAbs exhibited a similar pattern of early signaling events in activated T cells and Jurkat cells (p56(lck) activation, association of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase with CD28), indicating that the signaling capacity of CD28 changes with activation.

Analysis of the accumulation of mRNA-encoding members of the AP-1 transcription factor family demonstrated that c-fos and junB are also expressed upon stimulation of NK and T cells with IL-2, but not IL-12, whereas expression of c-jun and junD is not modified by either cytokine.
('IL-2', 'Gene_expression', 'c-jun'),('IL-2', 'Gene_expression', 'junD')

Analysis of the expression of genes reported to regulate cytokine-induced proliferation demonstrated that both IL-2 and IL-12 induce c-myc mRNA accumulation in NK and T cells, whereas only IL-2 induces bcl-2 expression.
('IL-2', 'Positive_regulation', 'c-myc'),('IL-2', 'Gene_expression', 'bcl-2')

Expression of the human interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor alpha chain gene is potently upregulated by its own ligand, IL-2.
('IL-2', 'Gene_expression', 'interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor alpha chain')

However, it was not possible to ascertain whether Bcl-2 upregulation was a specific consequence of LMP1 expression or an artifact of the selection procedure whereby rare Bcl-2+ cells already present in the starting population might best be able to tolerate the potentially toxic effects of LMP1.
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'Bcl-2')

We therefore reexamined this issue by using two different experimental approaches that allowed LMP1- induced effects to be monitored immediately following expression of the viral protein and in the absence of selective pressures; activation of the NF-kappa B transcription factor and upregulation of the cell adhesion molecule ICAM-1 were used as early indices of LMP1 function.
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'ICAM-1')

All six B-cell lines tested showed NF-kappa B activation in response to LMP1 expression, and this was followed in five of six lines by expression of ICAM-1 and Bcl-2.
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'Bcl-2'),('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'ICAM-1')

We therefore conclude that Bcl-2 upregulation is part of the panoply of cellular changes induced by LMP1 but that the effect is cell type specific.
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'Bcl-2')

Luciferase assays revealed a approximately20-fold increased transcriptional activity of the 1025 bp sequence as compared to the empty vector, indicating that we had identified an active A3G promoter sequence (Figure 3B).

The regulation of interleukin-2 receptor alpha chain (IL-2R alpha) expression and nuclear factor (NF) activation by protein kinase C (PKC) in resting T cells, has been studied.
('IL-2', 'Negative_regulation', 'IL-2R alpha')

Treatment of human resting T cells with phorbol esters strongly induced the expression of IL-2R alpha and the activation of NF.kappa B.
('IL-2', 'Negative_regulation', 'IL-2R alpha')

This activation was due to the translocation of p65 and c-Rel NF.kappa B proteins from cytoplasmic stores to the nucleus, where they bound the kappa B sequence of the IL-2R alpha promoter either as p50.p65 or as p50.c-Rel heterodimers.
('IL-2', 'Negative_regulation', 'IL-2R alpha')

Furthermore, cyclosporin A, which blocked TNF alpha production induced by PKC, strongly inhibited IL-2R alpha and NF.kappa B activation.
('TNF alpha', 'Negative_regulation', 'IL-2R alpha'),('IL-2', 'Negative_regulation', 'IL-2R alpha')

The addition of either TNF alpha or IL-2 partially recovered cyclosporin A-induced IL-2R alpha inhibition, but only TNF alpha completely recovered NF.kappa B activation.
('TNF alpha', 'Negative_regulation', 'IL-2R alpha'),('IL-2', 'Negative_regulation', 'IL-2R alpha')

Those results indicate that, in resting T cells, PKC activation has only a triggering role, whereas the endogenously secreted TNF alpha plays an essential role in the quantitative control of the expression of IL-2R alpha chain or NF.kappa B activation.

Transcription factors RUNX1 and RUNX3 in the induction and suppressive function of Foxp3+inducible regulatory T cells
('RUNX3', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3')

In this study, we show that the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) induces the expression of the Runt-related transcription factors RUNX1 and RUNX3 in CD4+ T cells.
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'RUNX3'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'RUNX1')

Inactivation of the gene encoding RUNX cofactor core-binding factor-beta (CBFbeta) in mice and small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated suppression of RUNX1 and RUNX3 in human T cells resulted in reduced expression of Foxp3.
('core-binding factor-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3'),('RUNX3', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3')

Circulating human CD4+ CD25high CD127- T reg cells significantly expressed higher levels of RUNX3, FOXP3, and TGF-beta mRNA compared with CD4+CD25- cells.
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'RUNX3')

These data demonstrate Runx transcription factors as a molecular link in TGF-beta-induced Foxp3 expression in iT reg cell differentiation and function.

Tpl-2 induces IL-2 expression in T-cell lines by triggering multiple signaling pathways that activate NFAT and NF-kappaB.
('Tpl-2', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2')

The Tpl-2 kinase activates the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) and induces IL-2 expression in T-cell lines.
('Tpl-2', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2')

Here we show that the activation of the IL-2 promoter by Tpl-2 is inhibited by mutant signaling molecules that inhibit the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) or the calcineurin/NFAT pathways and is promoted by combinations of signaling molecules that activate these pathways.
('Tpl-2', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2')

We, therefore, conclude that signals generated by the convergence of the MAPK and the calcineurin/NFAT pathway are necessary and sufficient for the activation of the IL-2 promoter by Tpl-2.
('Tpl-2', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2')

However, it was only the IL-2 promoter whose activation by Tpl-2 was fully blocked by the dominant negative mutant MEK1S218/222A and the MEK1/MEK2 inhibitor PD098059.
('Tpl-2', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2')

While the activation of the IL-2 promoter and an NFAT-driven minimal promoter by Tpl-2 was fully blocked by the dominant negative mutant NFAT delta418, it was only partially blocked by the calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporin A suggesting that the Tpl-2-mediated NFAT activation is under the control of a combination of calcineurin-dependent and independent pathways.
('Tpl-2', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2')

In HIV-1-infected monocytes Tat sustains the NF-kappaB activity and promotes the transcriptional activation of MIP-1alpha by interacting with IkappaB-alpha and p65
('p65', 'Gene_expression', 'MIP-1alpha'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65'),('Tat', 'Gene_expression', 'IkappaB-alpha'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'MIP-1alpha'),('Tat', 'Gene_expression', 'MIP-1alpha')

We next analysed whether Tat affected the NF-kappaB activity and the expression of MIP-1alpha in the course of HIV-1 infection.
('Tat', 'Binding', 'MIP-1alpha'),('Tat', 'Gene_expression', 'MIP-1alpha')

Cells were transfected with siRNA Tat, siRNA control or left untransfected to modulate the Tat expression, and then analysed for the kinetic of NF-kappaB activation following viral infection.
('siRNA Tat', 'Gene_expression', 'Tat')

The expression of Tat and p24 was detected at 3- to 12-h post-infection, while it was barely detected in siRNA Tat-transfected cells (Figure 6A).
('siRNA Tat', 'Gene_expression', 'Tat'),('siRNA Tat', 'Gene_expression', 'p24')

The NF-kappaB activity, as measured by p65 DNA binding, was induced at 3-h post-infection in both Tat-positive (no siRNA and siRNA control) and Tat-negative cells (siRNA Tat), and increased at 12 h only in Tat-positive cells (Figure 6B).
('siRNA Tat', 'Gene_expression', 'Tat'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65')

Degradation of IkappaB-alpha was observed at 3-h post-infection, and was followed by de novo synthesis of IkappaB-alpha at 12 h independently of the Tat presence (Figure 6C).
('IkappaB-alpha', 'Gene_expression', 'IkappaB-alpha'),('Tat', 'Gene_expression', 'IkappaB-alpha')

In HIV-1-infected U937 cells, the endogenous Tat was coimmunoprecipitated with IkappaB-alpha and p65 (Figure 6E), and activated the MIP-1alpha expression in a p65-dependent manner, as shown by the lack of effect following RNA interference of Tat or p65 (Figure 6F).
('p65', 'Gene_expression', 'MIP-1alpha'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65'),('Tat', 'Gene_expression', 'IkappaB-alpha'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'MIP-1alpha'),('Tat', 'Gene_expression', 'MIP-1alpha')

Moreover, Tat and p65 were both recruited to the NF-kappaB enhancer of MIP-1alpha, while the p65 occupancy was abolished by siRNA Tat (Figure 6G and H).

Altogether these results indicated that in single round HIV-1 infection Tat associated with IkappaB-alpha and p65, and induced the p65-dependent activation of MIP-1alpha expression through occupancy of the MIP-1alpha promoter and increased recruitment of p65.

Interferon regulatory factor 2 (IRF-2) is a transcriptional regulatory protein that terminates interferon beta expression initiated by interferon regulatory factor 1.
('IRF-2', 'Gene_expression', 'interferon beta'),('interferon regulatory factor 1', 'Gene_expression', 'interferon beta'),('interferon regulatory factor 1', 'Transcription', 'IRF-2')

This region contains elements which are shared with the transcriptional enhancers of other genes including interferon regulatory factor 1, interferon beta, and interferon-inducible genes.
('interferon regulatory factor 1', 'Gene_expression', 'interferon beta')

These data suggest that interferon regulatory factor 1 not only triggers the activation of the interferon signal transduction pathway, but also may play a role in limiting the duration of this response by activating the transcription of IRF-2.

Targeted degradation of c-Fos, but not v-Fos, by a phosphorylation-dependent signal on c-Jun.
('c-Jun', 'Protein_catabolism', 'c-Fos')

The proto-oncogene products c-Fos and c-Jun heterodimerize through their leucine zippers to form the AP-1 transcription factor.
('c-Jun', 'Protein_catabolism', 'c-Fos')

In transient expression and in vitro degradation experiments, the stability of c-Fos was decreased when the protein was dimerized with phosphorylated c-Jun.
('c-Jun', 'Protein_catabolism', 'c-Fos')

c-Jun protein isolated from phorbol ester-induced cells did not target c-Fos for degradation, which suggests that c-Fos is transiently stabilized after stimulation of cell growth.
('c-Fos', 'Negative_regulation', 'c-Fos'),('c-Jun', 'Protein_catabolism', 'c-Fos')

v-Fos protein, the retroviral counterpart of c-Fos, was not susceptible to degradation targeted by c-Jun.

In HIV-1 infection Tat sustains the NF-kappaB activity and enhances the MIP-1alpha expression via interaction with IkappaB-alpha and p65.
('Tat', 'Gene_expression', 'MIP-1alpha')

Even though Cbfb-deficient CD4+ T cells had impaired induction of Foxp3 after stimulation with anti-CD3/28 mAbs and TGF-beta, sufficient numbers of Foxp3+ cells could be generated to permit analysis of their suppressive activity.
('Cbfb', 'Positive_regulation', 'Foxp3')

Purified naive CD4+ T cells from CbfbF/F CD4-cre and control CbfbF/+ CD4-cre mice (Cd45.2) harboring a Foxp3-ires-GFP allele (Bettelli et al., 2006) were stimulated in vitro with anti-CD3/28 mAbs, IL-2, and TGF-beta.
('Cbfb', 'Positive_regulation', 'Foxp3')

The suppression was significantly reduced when cells from CbfbF/F CD4-cre mice were used, demonstrating that TGF-beta-induced Runx complexes are important for the suppressive activity of Foxp3+ T reg cells (Fig.
('Cbfb', 'Positive_regulation', 'Foxp3')

Foxp3+ and Foxp3- cells generated from both CbfbF/F CD4-cre and control cells all displayed similar proliferation rates and cell death as measured by CFSE dilution and annexin V staining, respectively (Fig.
('Cbfb', 'Positive_regulation', 'Foxp3')

These results demonstrate the important role of RUNX1 and RUNX3 not only for the induction of FOXP3, but also for the suppressive capacity of iT reg cells both in humans and in mice.
('RUNX1', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

In the suppression experiment with human cells, reduced suppressive activity was caused by reduced FOXP3 expression in T cells by siRNA inhibition of RUNX1 and RUNX3.
('RUNX1', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

Recombinant NFAT1 can mediate transcription of the interleukin-2, interleukin-4, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor promoters in T cells, suggesting that NFAT1 contributes to the CsA-sensitive transcription of these genes during the immune response.
('NFAT1', 'Transcription', 'interleukin-4'),('NFAT1', 'Transcription', 'interleukin-2'),('NFAT1', 'Transcription', 'granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor'),('NFAT1', 'Transcription', 'tumor necrosis factor alpha')

Both c-Rel and RelA induced jagged1 gene expression, whereas a mutant defective for transactivation did not.
('c-Rel', 'Gene_expression', 'jagged1'),('RelA', 'Gene_expression', 'jagged1')

Importantly, jagged1 transcripts were also upregulated by endogenous NF-kappaB activation and this effect was inhibited by a dominant mutant of IkappaBalpha, a physiological inhibitor of NF-kappaB.
('IkappaBalpha', 'Positive_regulation', 'jagged1')

These results demonstrate that c-Rel can trigger the Notch signaling pathway in neighboring cells by inducing jagged1 gene expression, and suggest a role for Jagged1 in B-cell activation, differentiation or function.
('c-Rel', 'Gene_expression', 'jagged1')

GATA-3 determines Th2 cell differentiation and selectively activates the promoters of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 through chromatin remodelling [4]-[7].
('GATA-3', 'Gene_expression', '-13'),('GATA-3', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-5')

The key role of GATA-3 in allergic airway inflammation has been demonstrated in mice by the reduced release of Th2 cytokines in animals treated with dominant-negative mutants of GATA-3 and by local application of antisense oligonucleotides to GATA-3 [8],[9].
('GATA-3', 'Binding', 'GATA-3')

Corticosteroids mediate their anti-inflammatory effects through binding to glucocorticoid receptors (GRs), which then translocate to the nucleus where they interact with glucocorticoid response elements (GREs) in the promoter regions of steroid-sensitive genes.
('GR', 'Localization', 'GR')

Using overexpression and CAT-reporter genes, Lavender and colleagues [33] have shown that GR reduced GATA-3-mediated IL-5 and -13 promoter activity in human CD4+ T cells.
('GATA-3', 'Gene_expression', '-13'),('GR', 'Binding', 'GATA-3'),('GATA-3', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-5')

The authors postulated that local recruitment of GR may alter the ability of GATA-3 either to bind to its target site, to cause transcriptional up-regulation, or to maintain an environment that is permissive for transcription.
('GR', 'Binding', 'GATA-3')

However, although Wnt signals are known to inhibit the activity of the negative regulatory protein kinase glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta), resulting in increased levels of beta-catenin, we find no evidence for involvement of GSK-3beta in Tcf-mediated transcription in T cells.
('GSK-3beta', 'Positive_regulation', 'beta-catenin')

IL-10 Production by Th2 and Th17 Cells Also Requires ERK1 and ERK2 Activation
('ERK2', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('ERK1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

To address whether IL-10 production by Th2 and Th17 cells was also dependent on ERK1 and ERK2 activation, we differentiated these cells with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 in the absence of APCs (Shoemaker et al., 2006; Veldhoen et al., 2009; Veldhoen et al., 2006), in the presence or absence of the MEK inhibitor (PD184352).
('ERK2', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('ERK1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('MEK', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

We showed that ERK1 and ERK2 activation is a common pathway required for induction of IL-10 in different Th cell subsets because IL-10 production by both Th2 and Th17 cells was markedly inhibited in the presence of the MEK inhibitor (PD184352) (Figure 5D and Figure S5B).
('ERK2', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('ERK1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('MEK', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Activation of the ERK1 and ERK2 signaling pathway is therefore a common requirement for the induction of IL-10 production by Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells.
('ERK2', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('ERK1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Although TGF-beta-reduced CD25, IL-4 expression, and CD25 expression (Figure 6B), IL-4 significantly inhibited TGF-beta-mediated induction of FOXP3 in naive T cells driven toward FOXP3+ T cells, as shown by FACS analysis (Figure 6A).
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-4'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'CD25'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Negative_regulation', 'CD25')

It is known that IL-4 is a potent growth factor and may therefore favor the proliferation of FOXP3- cells and thus decrease the relative percentage of FOXP3+ cells.
('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

However, analysis of cell division kinetics by CFSE-labeling demonstrated that IL-4 did not differentially promote cell growth of FOXP3+ over that of FOXP3-.
('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

Furthermore the TGF-beta-mediated induction of FOXP3 expression was not caused by overgrowth of a CD25-FOXP3+ minority, since the number of FOXP3+ cells was low/absent in the purified CD4+CD45RA+ T cells (between 0% and 1%), and the FOXP3+ cells were not confined to the highly divided cells.
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'CD25')

CD25 was down-regulated in TGF-beta-treated cells compare to activated T cells, which was even more pronounced in cells cultured with TGF-beta and IL-4.
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-4'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'CD25'),('IL-4', 'Negative_regulation', 'CD25')

The addition of IL-4 to iTreg-driving conditions decreased the number of FOXP3+ cells (Figure 6B).
('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

In line with the previous findings, the IL-4-producing cells and the FOXP3 expressing cells are nonoverlapping populations.
('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

The expression kinetic of naive T cells exposed to IL-4 and TGF-beta demonstrated that GATA3 and FOXP3 are initially found in separate populations (day 2), but transiently co-express both factors (days 4-8), before establishing separate populations at the end of the differentiation process (day 10; Figure 6C), suggesting that GATA3 inhibits the development of iTreg cells by repressing FOXP3.
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-4'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'GATA3'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'GATA3'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

These results showed that IL-4 acts in vitro as an inhibitor of FOXP3 expression, without interfering with TGF-beta signaling, probably acting at the level of transcription factors, and possibly by a GATA3-dependent mechanism.

('hGATA-3', 'Transcription', 'TcR delta'),('hGATA-3', 'Gene_expression', 'TcR delta')

All NK clones and cell lines studied were found to express hGATA-3-specific mRNA, suggesting that hGATA-3 may be involved in the regulation of the unrearranged TcR delta gene expression in NK cells.

LMP1 Upregulates IL10 and Constitutively Activates Stat3
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL10'),('IL10', 'Positive_regulation', 'Stat3')

Transcription of IL10, IL15, and IFNgamma were reproducibly detected in LMP1 transgenic lymphocytes and lymphoma cells and was higher than in the B cell lymphoma cell lines 967 and K46mu (Figure 5A).
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL10'),('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'IFNgamma'),('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL15')

There was no significant difference in the expression of IL15 and IFNgamma between LMP1 transgenic lymphocytes and lymphoma cells, suggesting that upregulation of IL15 and IFNgamma is induced by LMP1 expression in healthy lymphocytes but is not a unique property of malignant lymphocytes.
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'IFNgamma'),('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL15')

Strikingly, IL10, a B lymphocyte stimulatory cytokine, was increased 1.5- to 5-fold in the wild-type and LMP1 transgenic lymphoma cells compared to LMP1 transgenic lymphocytes (Figure 5A).
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL10')

Immunoblot analysis indicated that LMP1 transgenic lymphocytes and wild-type and LMP1 transgenic lymphoma cells had corresponding increased levels of phosphorylated alpha and beta isoforms of activated Stat3, a target of the IL10 receptor (Figure 5B).
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL10'),('IL10', 'Positive_regulation', 'Stat3')

However, when comparing the same lymphomas, there was no correlation between the levels of IL10 induction and the levels of Stat3 activation.
('IL10', 'Positive_regulation', 'Stat3')

This suggests that the activation of Stat3 is not solely induced by IL10 or that Stat3 activation may be constitutive.
('IL10', 'Positive_regulation', 'Stat3')

Additionally, there was no correlation between the levels of LMP1 expression and the levels of IL10 induction (Figures 1A and 5A).
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL10')

This indicates that the induction of IL10 is a general property associated with enhanced survival and may only be indirectly affected by LMP1.
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL10')

Neutralizing antibodies to IL10 did not affect the survival of lymphoma cells as determined by the MTS assay (unpublished data), suggesting constitutive activation of Stat3.
('IL10', 'Positive_regulation', 'Stat3')

This was confirmed by immunoblot analysis such that in the presence of anti-IL10 neutralizing antibodies, pStat3 levels remained activated in lymphoma cells isolated from wild-type and LMP1 transgenic lymphomas (Figure 5C).
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL10'),('IL10', 'Positive_regulation', 'pStat3'),('IL10', 'Positive_regulation', 'Stat3')

Exogenous addition of IL10 enhanced pStat3 activation above constitutive levels, indicating that lymphoma cells are responsive to IL10 treatment (Figure 5C).
('IL10', 'Positive_regulation', 'pStat3'),('IL10', 'Positive_regulation', 'Stat3')

This means that although the lymphoma cells have constitutive Stat3 activation, it may be further enhanced by IL10 induction.
('IL10', 'Positive_regulation', 'Stat3')

Nuclear translocation of pStat3 is a consequence of activation, and nuclear pStat3 was not detected by immunohistochemistry staining of spleen sections from control mice.

Role of CBFbeta in the induction of Foxp3
('CBFbeta', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3')

To target all Runx proteins that might be involved in the induction of Foxp3, we used mice in which loxP-flanked Cbfb alleles were inactivated in T cells through expression of a CD4-cre transgene.
('Runx', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3'),('Runx', 'Positive_regulation', 'Foxp3')

Retinoic acid and TGF-beta synergize in the induction of Foxp3 in naive T cells (Kang et al., 2007).
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3')

To investigate whether Runx-mediated induction of Foxp3 is dependent on the expression of CBFbeta, naive CD4+ CD8- T cells from CbfbF/F CD4-cre and control CbfbF/+ CD4-cre mice were stimulated with anti-CD3/28 mAbs, retinoic acid, and increasing concentrations of TGF-beta.
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3'),('Runx', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3'),('CBFbeta', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3'),('Runx', 'Positive_regulation', 'Foxp3')

After 3 d in culture, the cells were restimulated with PMA and ionomycin and analyzed for intracellular Foxp3 and IFN-gamma expression.
('IFN-gamma', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3')

TGF-beta induced Foxp3 in CbfbF/+ CD4-cre cells in a dose dependent manner, and this was significantly reduced in CbfbF/F CD4-cre cells.
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3')

Retinoic acid enhanced Foxp3 expression even in 20 pg/ml of TGF-beta and more than 95% of the CD4+ T cells from CbfbF/+ CD4-cre mice became Foxp3+ in 100 and 500 pg/ml TGF-beta doses.
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3')

The induction of Foxp3 was again significantly lower in CbfbF/F CD4-cre CD4+ T cells even in the presence of retinoic acid, demonstrating that deficiency in Runx binding to DNA affects the TGF-beta induction of Foxp3 in T reg cells (Fig.
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3'),('Runx', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3'),('Runx', 'Positive_regulation', 'Foxp3')

There was no difference in the induction of Foxp3 when endogenous IL-4 and IFN-gamma were neutralized (Fig.

The importance of RUNX transcription factors for the in vivo conversion of naive CD4+ T cells into iT reg cells was examined.

To investigate the effect of RUNX1 and RUNX3 binding to the RUNX binding sites in the FOXP3 promoter, we transfected human peripheral blood CD4+ T cells with a FOXP3 promoter luciferase reporter vector and RUNX1 or RUNX3 expression vectors.
('RUNX3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

An increase in luciferase activity was observed only when the FOXP3 promoter (-511 to +176) luciferase construct was cotransfected with RUNX1 or RUNX3 expression vectors (Fig.
('RUNX3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

In these experiments, the overexpression of RUNX1 and RUNX3 eliminated the need of TGF-beta for FOXP3 promoter activation and PMA/ionomycin stimulation was sufficient.
('RUNX3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

To examine the role of each of the three RUNX binding sites for the FOXP3 promoter activity, we mutated each individually or in combination.

4 B), suggesting that the identified binding sites have redundant functions and RUNX binding to more than one site is necessary for the full activation of the FOXP3 promoter.
('RUNX', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

Supporting these findings, the overexpression of RUNX1 in human primary CD4+ T cells resulted in significantly elevated levels of FOXP3 protein measured by flow cytometry after 48 h. This was achieved without any requirement for anti-CD3, anti-CD28 stimulation, or the presence of TGF-beta.

Regulation of M-CSF expression by M-CSF: role of protein kinase C and transcription factor NF kappa B.
('M-CSF', 'Gene_expression', 'M-CSF')

The detection of both M-CSF and c-fms expression by cells of the monocyte lineage has suggested that M-CSF may act by an autocrine mechanism.
('M-CSF', 'Gene_expression', 'M-CSF')

Although sensitivity to M-CSF can be modulated by regulation of receptor expression and function, M-CSF responsiveness is largely determined at a postreceptor level.
('M-CSF', 'Gene_expression', 'M-CSF')

Inhibition of PKC by the isoquinoline derivative H7 abolishes induction of M-CSF by M-CSF.

('M-CSF', 'Gene_expression', 'M-CSF')

BACKGROUND: The induction of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and E-selectin by tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) is mediated by mobilization of the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B).
('TNF', 'Localization', 'VCAM-1'),('TNF', 'Localization', 'E-selectin')

Induction of VCAM-1 and E-selectin surface expression by TNF was dose-dependently reduced by aspirin over the same range, while induction of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) was hardly affected.
('TNF', 'Localization', 'VCAM-1'),('TNF', 'Localization', 'E-selectin')

Aspirin appeared to prevent VCAM-1 transcription, since it dose-dependently inhibited induction of VCAM-1 mRNA by TNF.
('TNF', 'Localization', 'VCAM-1')

As a functional consequence, adhesion of U937 monocytes to TNF-stimulated HUVECs was markedly reduced by aspirin due to suppression of VCAM-1 and E-selectin upregulation.
('TNF', 'Localization', 'VCAM-1'),('TNF', 'Localization', 'E-selectin')

CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that aspirin inhibits NF-kappa B mobilization, induction of VCAM-1 and E-selectin, and subsequent monocyte adhesion in endothelial cells stimulated by TNF, thereby providing an additional mechanism for therapeutic effects of aspirin.

Recent studies indicate that HTLV-1 Tax targets IkappaBalpha to the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.
('Tax', 'Protein_catabolism', 'IkappaBalpha')

In this report, we provide evidence that in addition to acting on IkappaBalpha, Tax stimulates the turnover Of IkappaBbeta via a related targeting mechanism.
('Tax', 'Protein_catabolism', 'IkappaBalpha'),('Tax', 'Protein_catabolism', 'IkappaBbeta')

Like IkappaBalpha, Tax-mediated breakdown of IkappaBbeta in transfected T lymphocytes is blocked either by cell-permeable proteasome inhibitors or by mutation Of IkappaBbeta at two serine residues present within its N-terminal region.
('Tax', 'Protein_catabolism', 'IkappaBalpha'),('Tax', 'Protein_catabolism', 'IkappaBbeta')

Despite the dual specificity of HTLV-1 Tax for IkappaBalpha and IkappaBbeta at the protein level, Tax selectively stimulates NF-kappaB-directed transcription of the IkappaBalpha gene.
('Tax', 'Protein_catabolism', 'IkappaBalpha'),('Tax', 'Protein_catabolism', 'IkappaBbeta')

These findings with IkappaBbeta provide a potential mechanism for the constitutive activation of NF-kappaB in Tax-expressing cells.

Histamine transiently increased cAMP and c-fos expression through H2 receptors.
('H2 receptors', 'Gene_expression', 'c-fos')

Dose-dependence studies using histamine and dimaprit showed that the EC50 values for cAMP production and c-fos increase were similar, suggesting that cAMP might be involved in c-fos induction via H2 receptors.
('H2 receptors', 'Gene_expression', 'c-fos')

These results indicate that histamine activates several mechanisms involved in the induction of differentiation, such as cAMP and c-fos production, but fails to promote differentiation of U937 cells, apparently due to the rapid desensitization of H2 receptors.

Role of EGR1 in regulation of stimulus-dependent CD44 transcription in B lymphocytes.
('EGR1', 'Positive_regulation', 'CD44')

Here we identify the gene encoding the lymphocyte homing and migration protein CD44 as a target of EGR1 regulation in B cells.
('EGR1', 'Positive_regulation', 'CD44')

BCR-induced increases in CD44 mRNA expression and transcription levels are shown to occur in EGR1-expressing but not in nonexpressing subclones of the B-cell line WEHI-231.
('EGR1', 'Positive_regulation', 'CD44')

Kinetics of egr-1 transcription and the appearance of nuclear EGR1 protein precede CD44 induction and occur within 30 min after stimulation in the EGR1-expressing subclone.
('EGR1', 'Positive_regulation', 'CD44')

A single EGR1 binding motif is demonstrated at bp -301 of the human CD44 promoter.
('EGR1', 'Positive_regulation', 'CD44')

The EGR1 binding motif was shown to be necessary for stimulus-induced expression of a CD44 promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter construct in nontransformed B lymphocytes and was required for transactivation by an EGR1 expression vector in a B-cell line.
('EGR1', 'Positive_regulation', 'CD44')

These studies identify EGR1 as an intermediary linking BCR-derived signals to the induction of CD44.

v-erbA overexpression is required to extinguish c-erbA function in erythroid cell differentiation and regulation of the erbA target gene CAII.
('v-erbA', 'Transcription', 'CAII'),('v-erbA', 'Regulation', 'CAII')

Here, we show that v-erbA and c-erbA bind directly to sequences within the promoter of the erythrocyte-specific carbonic anhydrase II (CAII), a gene whose transcription is efficiently suppressed by v-erbA.
('v-erbA', 'Transcription', 'CAII'),('v-erbA', 'Regulation', 'CAII')

This erbA-binding site confers thyroid hormone responsiveness to a heterologous promoter in transient expression experiments and is a target for efficient down-regulation of CAII transcription by the v-erbA oncoprotein.
('v-erbA', 'Transcription', 'CAII'),('v-erbA', 'Regulation', 'CAII')

In the present report, we studied the role of the stromal-derived cytokine interleukin-7 (IL-7) in the IL-2-gene regulation in activated T lymphocytes.
('IL-7', 'Transcription', 'IL-2'),('IL-7', 'Regulation', 'IL-2')

Costimulation of phytohemagglutinin/anti-CD28 activated T lymphocytes with IL-7 induces a fivefold enhanced IL-2-mRNA accumulation and a 2.5-fold enhanced protein secretion.

The IL-2-gene transcription rate is increased 3.4-fold, indicating that the effect of IL-7 is in part mediated at the transcriptional level.

The role of the viral trans-activator Tax protein in the induction of VCAM-1 was first indicated by the detection of this adhesion molecule on Jurkat T-cell clones stably expressing the tax gene.
('Tax', 'Positive_regulation', 'VCAM-1'),('Tax', 'Transcription', 'VCAM-1'),('Tax', 'Gene_expression', 'VCAM-1')

The effect of Tax on VCAM-1 gene transcription was next confirmed in JPX-9 cells, a subclone of Jurkat cells, carrying the tax sequences under the control of an inducible promoter.
('Tax', 'Positive_regulation', 'VCAM-1'),('Tax', 'Transcription', 'VCAM-1'),('Tax', 'Gene_expression', 'VCAM-1')

Furthermore, deletion and mutation analyses of the VCAM-1 promoter performed with chloramphenicol acetyltransferase constructs revealed that Tax was trans activating the VCAM-1 promoter via two NF-kappaB sites present at bp -72 and -57 in the VCAM-1 gene promoter, with both of them being required for the Tax-induced expression of this adhesion molecule.
('Tax', 'Positive_regulation', 'VCAM-1'),('Tax', 'Transcription', 'VCAM-1'),('Tax', 'Gene_expression', 'VCAM-1')

Finally, gel mobility shift assays demonstrated the nuclear translocation of proteins specifically bound to these two NF-kappaB motifs, confirming that VCAM-1 was induced on Tax-expressing cells in a kappaB-dependent manner.
('Tax', 'Positive_regulation', 'VCAM-1'),('Tax', 'Transcription', 'VCAM-1'),('Tax', 'Gene_expression', 'VCAM-1')

Collectively, these results therefore suggest that the exclusive Tax-induced expression of VCAM-1 on T cells may represent a pivotal event in the progression of HTLV-1-associated diseases.

T-bet is induced by TCR signals and is essential for early IFN-gamma expression.

Eomes may participate in sustaining late IFN-gamma expression, whereas Runx3 and Eomes (but not T-bet) may cooperate to activate perforin expression.

A region that may also be important with respect to Foxp3 function is the leucine zipper domain, as demonstrated by the number of mutations associated with IPEX that have been mapped in this region of Foxp3.
('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'Foxp3')

Because the pathogenesis of a number of retroviral-induced immunologic disorders such as HIV-1/AIDS and HTLV-I/HAM/TSP have been associated with dysregulation of Foxp3 expression [8,45], we also examined the role of Foxp3 in retroviral gene expression.
('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'Foxp3')

In addition, the FKH domain of Foxp3 was required for this inhibitory effect in HEK 293T cells, but not in Jurkat T cells, similar to Foxp3-mediated suppression of a synthetic NF-kappaB reporter.
('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'Foxp3')

Foxp3 also affected two well-known functions of HTLV-I Tax: transactivation of the NF-kappaB pathway and, most surprisingly, transactivation of the HTLV-I LTR.
('Tax', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3')

Transactivation of the HTLV-I LTR by Tax involves the interaction of ATF/CREB factors with Tax in the nucleus.
('Tax', 'Binding', 'Tax')

Binding of Tax enhances ATF/CREB dimerization and promotes assembly of Tax-ATF/CREB complexes onto specific sequences in the viral promoter known as Tax-responsive elements.
('Tax', 'Binding', 'Tax')

Transactivation of the NF-kappaB pathway by Tax was inhibited by overexpression of full-length Foxp3, but not DeltaFKH, as seen with basal activation of the HIV-1 LTR and a synthetic NF-kappaB reporter in HEK 293T cells.
('Tax', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3')

However, Tax-mediated transactivation of the HTLV-I LTR was inhibited by overexpression of both full-length Foxp3 as well as DeltaFKH in both HEK 293T cells and CD4+ T cells.
('Tax', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3')

We demonstrated that Foxp3 did not directly affect the functioning of Tax, but rather Foxp3 targeted the transcription factors required for Tax transactivation (i.e., NF-kappaB and a then-unknown cellular factor, which we identified in this study as CREB).
('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'Foxp3'),('Tax', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3'),('Tax', 'Binding', 'Tax')

Importantly, we demonstrated that HTLV-I-infected individuals with the highest levels of Foxp3 protein expression within the CD4+CD25+ T cells population exhibited lower proviral loads than did individuals with the lowest levels of Foxp3 protein expression.
('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'Foxp3')

Therefore, Foxp3 becomes an attractive target for the development of novel therapeutic applications directed at modulating the expression of this important regulatory protein, especially in light of recent observations that the expression of Foxp3 can also be down-regulated by HTLV-I Tax [8].
('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'Foxp3'),('Tax', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3')

As the activation of the HTLV-I LTR depends primarily on ATF/CREB proteins (whether in the presence or the absence of Tax), we investigated whether Foxp3 could interact with this additional cellular signaling pathway.
('Tax', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3')

Our data demonstrate that Foxp3 interferes with the latter of these two processes and that the recruitment of the coactivator protein p300, and resulting transcriptional activation are blocked by Foxp3.
('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'p300'),('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'Foxp3')

This may be the result of the physical interaction we detected between Foxp3 and p300.
('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'p300')

With respect to HTLV-I LTR activity, while full-length Foxp3 inhibited both basal and Tax-dependent transcription by ~50%, DeltaFKH appeared less effective in suppressing basal activation (~25% inhibition) compared to Tax-dependent activation (~50% inhibition).
('Tax', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3'),('Tax', 'Binding', 'Tax')

Future studies will be directed at identifying and characterizing cellular proteins that interact with Foxp3 both in the nucleus and cytoplasm, in order to better address how Foxp3 functions to guide the development and function of regulatory T cells in health and disease.

Fab fragment of anti-E. chaffeensis immunoglobulin G complexed with E. chaffeensis did not induce any of these three cytokines, indicating that ehrlichial binding is required for IL-1beta mRNA expression and that binding of the immune complex to the Fc gamma receptor is required for TNF-alpha and IL-6 mRNA expression and enhanced IL-1beta mRNA expression.

Coupling of the upstream beta globin sequence from approximately -500 to -250 bp to the truncated delta promoter fragment led to complete extinction of transcription activity, consistent with a negative regulatory effect of the beta globin gene upstream element(s).

Moreover, the mechanism of action of BHRF1 resembled that of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL as it inhibited TNF- and anti-Fas-induced activation of two enzymes participating in the apoptosis pathway, cytosolic phospholipase A2 and caspase-3/CPP32, but did not interfere with the activation of NF-kappaB-like transcription factors.

IL-12 and High Doses of Antigen Induce the Development of Th1 Cells Producing IL-10
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Culture of naive CD4+ T cells in an APC-free system by stimulation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies in the presence of IL-12 resulted in IFN-gamma-producing Th1 cells, a proportion of which coproduced IL-10, as did Th2 cells resulting from culture in IL-4 (Figure S1B).
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma')

To investigate whether the lack of IL-10 produced by Th1 cells resulted from inhibition of IL-10 production by DCs and high antigen dose or alternatively required IL-12, we cultured naive CD4+ T cells with increasing doses of antigen presented by DC in the presence of IL-12.
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

At low doses of antigen, IL-12 abrogated the development of Th2 cells and induced IFN-gamma expression but only low levels of IL-10 expression, suggesting that IL-12 per se was not sufficient to induce significant IL-10 production in Th1 cells (Figure 1A).
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma')

Strikingly, as the antigen dose was increased, Th1 populations driven with IL-12 now contained higher numbers of IL-10-producing cells (Figure 1A) and produced more IL-10 protein upon restimulation (Figures 1A and 1B).
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Thus, the development of Th1 cells producing IL-10 required both IL-12 and high doses of antigen.
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Th1 cells differentiated to produce large amounts of IL-10 and IFN-gamma and lost their capacity to produce IL-2 (Figure 1B).
('IL-2', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Because the presence of IL-12 reduced the proliferation of CD4+ T cells at both high and low antigen doses (Table S1), and only the former showed IL-10 production, the development of high IL-10-producing cells is most likely not related to limited IL-2.
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-2', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Naive CD4+ T cells from DO11.10/recombination-activating gene 1 (Rag1)-deficient animals, cultured with high doses of antigen in the presence of IL-12, also resulted in IL-10 expression by Th1 cells, showing that this expression was not dependent on the presence of effector or memory T cells or Treg cells (Figure S2).
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Although it has been suggested that TGF-beta can induce IL-10 in CD4+ T cells (Kitani et al., 2003; Schiott et al., 2000), we found that in developing Th1 and Th2 cells this was not the case (data not shown).
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

In fact, neutralization of TGF-beta led to increased IL-10 production by both T cell subsets (Figure S3).
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Thus, the development of IL-10-producing Th1 cells only depended on the presence of IL-12 together with high antigen dose and not on other soluble factors such as IL-2 or TGF-beta or on the presence of other T cell types.

Infection of human peripheral blood lymphocytes with HIV-1 in vitro resulted in increased interleukin-2 (IL-2) secretion in response to T cell activation via the CD3 and CD28 receptors.
('CD28', 'Localization', 'IL-2')

Expression of the HIV-1 transactivator Tat recapitulated this phenotype and was associated with increased IL-2 secretion in response to costimulation with CD3 plus CD28.
('CD28', 'Localization', 'IL-2')

IL-2 superinduction by Tat occurred at the transcriptional level, was mediated by the CD28-responsive element in the IL-2 promoter, and was exclusively dependent on the 29 amino acids encoded by the second exon of Tat.
('CD28', 'Localization', 'IL-2')

We recently demonstrated that HOIL-1L interacting protein (HOIP), a ubiquitin ligase that can catalyze the assembly of linear polyubiquitin chains [5], is recruited to CD40 in a TRAF2-dependent manner following engagement of CD40 by agonistic antibody [6].
('TRAF2', 'Binding', 'HOIL-1L interacting protein')

We found that the CD40-induced upregulation of CD80 (a costimulatory molecule for T cells) was defective in HOIP-deficient cells.

Involvement of adenylate cyclase and p70(S6)-kinase activation in IL-10 up-regulation in human monocytes by gp41 envelope protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1.
('gp41', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('p70(S6)-kinase', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('gp41', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10')

Our previous results show that recombinant gp41 (aa565-647), the extracellular domain of HIV-1 transmembrane glycoprotein, stimulates interleukin-10 (IL-10) production in human monocytes.
('gp41', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('gp41', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10')

In this study, we examined whether gp41-induced IL-10 up-regulation is mediated by the previously described synergistic activation of cAMP and NF-kappaB pathways.
('gp41', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('gp41', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10')

gp41 induced cAMP accumulation in monocytes in a time- and concentration-dependent manner and the adenylate cyclase inhibitor SQ 22536 suppressed gp41-induced IL-10 production in monocytes.
('gp41', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('gp41', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10')

In contrast, gp41 failed to stimulate NF-kappaB binding activity in as much as no NF-kappaB bound to the main NF-kappaB-binding site 2 of the IL-10 promoter after addition of gp41.
('gp41', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('gp41', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10')

Specific inhibitors of p70(S6)-kinase (rapamycin), and Gi protein (pertussis toxin), prevented induction of IL-10 production by gp41 in monocytes, while inhibitors of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) (wortmannin) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway (PD 98059) did not.
('gp41', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('p70(S6)-kinase', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('gp41', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10')

Thus HIV-1 gp41-induced IL-10 up-regulation in monocytes may not involve NF-kappaB, MAPK, or PI 3-kinase activation, but rather may operate through activation of adenylate cyclase and pertussis-toxin-sensitive Gi/Go protein to effect p70(S6)-kinase activation.

LMP1 Activates Akt Signaling and Deregulates the Rb Cell Cycle Pathway
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'Akt')

LMP1 transformation of rodent fibroblasts requires activation of PI3K and Akt [5].
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'Akt')

To determine if Akt signaling is activated in LMP1 transgenic mice, pAkt and several of its targets were assessed by immunoblotting of splenic CD19+ MACS-purified B cells.
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'Akt')

LMP1 transgenic B cells had increased levels of pAkt compared to wild-type lymphocytes; however, progression to lymphoma in both LMP1-positive and -negative lymphoma cells did not further increase pAkt levels.
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'Akt')

This finding indicates that GSK3 is not a target of activated Akt in the LMP1 transgenic lymphocytes and lymphoma cells.
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'Akt')

Activated p-mTOR was not increased in LMP1 transgenic lymphocytes or lymphoma cells, indicating that this pathway is not affected by LMP1-induced Akt activation and does not contribute to lymphoma development (Figure 6B).
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'Akt')

Immunoblot analysis indicated that total FoxO1 levels were greatly decreased in wild-type and LMP1 transgenic lymphomas (Figure 6B), suggesting that inhibition of the Forkhead signaling pathway is an important target of Akt in lymphoma development.
('Akt', 'Negative_regulation', 'FoxO1'),('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'Akt')

However, considering that Akt activation did not induce FoxO1 degradation in LMP1 transgenic B cells, Akt may not be the sole regulator of FoxO1, and it may be that progression to lymphoma requires modulation of multiple pathways.

Even though Cbfb-deficient CD4+ T cells had impaired induction of Foxp3 after stimulation with anti-CD3/28 mAbs and TGF-beta, sufficient numbers of Foxp3+ cells could be generated to permit analysis of their suppressive activity.
('Cbfb', 'Positive_regulation', 'Foxp3')

Purified naive CD4+ T cells from CbfbF/F CD4-cre and control CbfbF/+ CD4-cre mice (Cd45.2) harboring a Foxp3-ires-GFP allele (Bettelli et al., 2006) were stimulated in vitro with anti-CD3/28 mAbs, IL-2, and TGF-beta.
('Cbfb', 'Positive_regulation', 'Foxp3')

The suppression was significantly reduced when cells from CbfbF/F CD4-cre mice were used, demonstrating that TGF-beta-induced Runx complexes are important for the suppressive activity of Foxp3+ T reg cells (Fig.
('Cbfb', 'Positive_regulation', 'Foxp3')

Foxp3+ and Foxp3- cells generated from both CbfbF/F CD4-cre and control cells all displayed similar proliferation rates and cell death as measured by CFSE dilution and annexin V staining, respectively (Fig.
('Cbfb', 'Positive_regulation', 'Foxp3')

These results demonstrate the important role of RUNX1 and RUNX3 not only for the induction of FOXP3, but also for the suppressive capacity of iT reg cells both in humans and in mice.
('RUNX1', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

In the suppression experiment with human cells, reduced suppressive activity was caused by reduced FOXP3 expression in T cells by siRNA inhibition of RUNX1 and RUNX3.

We have now examined expression of the mouse E2A gene at the protein level using polyclonal antisera directed against distinct portions of the E2A protein to probe blots of cellular extracts.
('E2A', 'Positive_regulation', 'E2A')

Our results are consistent with the view that the DNA-binding activity LEF1/BCF1 is a homodimer of E2A proteins; the selective appearance of this putative cell-specific transcription factor in B lymphoid cells seems to be attributable, at least in part, to the elevated E2A protein concentrations in these cells.

Based on the evidence that Tat enhanced the transcriptional activity of the p65 subunit of NF-kappaB (49,63,64), and physically interacted with the IkappaB-alpha repressor (50,51), we investigated the possibility that Tat could activate NF-kappaB via direct interaction with IkappaB-alpha and p65.
('p65', 'Binding', 'Tat'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'IkappaB-alpha'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'Tat'),('p65', 'Regulation', 'p65'),('Tat', 'Negative_regulation', 'p65')

Upon HIV-1 infection, the early NF-kappaB activation occurred concomitantly with IKK activation and IkappaB-alpha degradation in the absence of Tat.
('Tat', 'Binding', 'IkappaB-alpha')

Soon after the shut off of IKK activity and new synthesis of IkappaB-alpha, the NF-kappaB activity was kept elevated in the presence of Tat, while it was down regulated upon silencing of the Tat gene.
('Tat', 'Binding', 'IkappaB-alpha'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'Tat')

These findings indicate that in single round HIV-1 infection, Tat enhanced the NF-kappaB activity without affecting the IKK activity and the half-life of IkappaB-alpha.
('Tat', 'Binding', 'IkappaB-alpha')

Similar kinetic of NF-kappaB activation occurred upon short-pulse of PMA in Tat-transfected HeLa cells, where Tat inhibited the post-activation turn off of NF-kappaB in presence of newly synthesized IkappaB-alpha.
('Tat', 'Binding', 'IkappaB-alpha'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'Tat')

The Tat-dependent activation of NF-kappaB correlated with the association of the viral protein with IkappaB-alpha, which interfered with the generation of the IkappaB-alpha/p65 complex.
('p65', 'Binding', 'Tat'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'IkappaB-alpha'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65'),('Tat', 'Negative_regulation', 'p65')

This evidence demonstrated that Tat competed for the binding of IkappaB-alpha to p65 and prevented the IkappaB-alpha repression of p65.
('p65', 'Binding', 'Tat'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'IkappaB-alpha'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65'),('p65', 'Regulation', 'p65'),('Tat', 'Negative_regulation', 'p65')

As additional mechanism of NF-kappaB activation, Tat associated with p65 and increased the p65 binding affinity to the NF-kappaB enhancer; this evidence was obtained with recombinant proteins indicating that the stronger binding of p65 to DNA was a consequence of direct association with Tat, which likely caused a conformational change of p65.
('p65', 'Binding', 'Tat'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'Tat'),('p65', 'Regulation', 'p65'),('Tat', 'Negative_regulation', 'p65')

We also demonstrated that the Tat cysteine-rich sequence (C22,25,27) was involved in the binding to the RHD of p65 and NF-kappaB activation.
('p65', 'Binding', 'Tat'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65'),('Tat', 'Negative_regulation', 'p65')

Differently, the Tat arginine-rich sequence (R49,52,53,55,56,57) was required for the binding to the sixth ankyrin of IkappaB-alpha (50,51), and for releasing p65 from the IkappaB-alpha inhibition.
('p65', 'Binding', 'Tat'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'IkappaB-alpha'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65'),('Tat', 'Negative_regulation', 'p65')

Altogether these results demonstrated that Tat abolished the negative feedback regulation of NF-kappaB by hijacking the IkappaB-alpha repressor, shielding p65 from the IkappaB-alpha embrace, and enforcing the p65 binding to DNA.
('p65', 'Binding', 'Tat'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'IkappaB-alpha'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65'),('p65', 'Regulation', 'p65'),('Tat', 'Negative_regulation', 'p65')

Further evidence of Tat activation of NF-kappaB showed that wild-type Tat, and not the Tat mutants lacking the arginine- or cysteine-rich domains, up-regulated in vivo the expression of a number of NF-kappaB-responsive genes, including MIP-1alpha, CSF3, LTA, NFKBIA and TLR2.
('Tat', 'Binding', 'Tat')

By ChIP analysis, we observed that Tat increased the recruitment of p65 to the NF-kappaB enhancers of the activated genes, and was recovered at the same sites.
('p65', 'Binding', 'Tat'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65'),('Tat', 'Negative_regulation', 'p65')

RNA interference of p65 abolished the Tat occupancy of the NF-kappaB enhancers indicating that the Tat binding to the NF-kappaB sites was mediated by p65.
('p65', 'Binding', 'Tat'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'Tat'),('p65', 'Regulation', 'p65'),('Tat', 'Negative_regulation', 'p65')

These results were consistent with the evidence that Tat displaced p65 from the binding to IkappaB-alpha (Figures 2D and 3C), and increased the p65 DNA binding affinity through association (Figure 4E and F).
('p65', 'Binding', 'Tat'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'IkappaB-alpha'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65'),('p65', 'Regulation', 'p65'),('Tat', 'Negative_regulation', 'p65')

Thus, Tat likely increased the recruitment of p65 to the NF-kappaB-dependent promoters by associating with p65 and by interfering with the assembly of p65 with the repressor IkappaB-alpha.
('p65', 'Binding', 'Tat'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'IkappaB-alpha'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65'),('p65', 'Regulation', 'p65'),('Tat', 'Negative_regulation', 'p65')

Of interest, IkappaB-alpha was found associated to the NF-kappaB enhancers in absence of Tat, where it was displaced in presence of Tat.
('Tat', 'Binding', 'IkappaB-alpha'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'Tat')

Indeed, IkappaB-alpha was found associated with hystone deacetylases at the hes1 promoter, from where it was removed following TNF-alpha stimulation causing histone acetylation and hes1 transcriptional activation (65).
('TNF-alpha', 'Binding', 'IkappaB-alpha'),('IkappaB-alpha', 'Positive_regulation', 'hes1')

A similar mechanism of gene regulation could apply to the NF-kappaB-dependent genes analysed in this study, where Tat could activate the gene expression by removing IkappaB-alpha and promoting the p65 loading (Figure 7).

The physiological relevance of Tat cross talk with NF-kappaB was demonstrated in the HIV-1 infection of human monocytes, where HIV-1-encoded Tat protein counteracted post-activation turn off of NF-kappaB, as shown by: (i) sustained NF-kappaB activity by Tat in presence of newly synthesized IkappaB-alpha; (ii) coimmunoprecipitation of Tat with IkappaB-alpha and p65; (iii) induction of MIP-1alpha expression dependent on Tat and p65; (iv) Tat occupancy of the MIP-1alpha NF-kappaB enhancer associated with increased recruitment of p65.

This study supports the pro-inflammatory action of Tat through physical interaction with p65 and IkappaB-alpha.
('p65', 'Binding', 'Tat'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'IkappaB-alpha'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65'),('Tat', 'Negative_regulation', 'p65')

In the case of TNF-alpha and IL-6, Tat activated the cytokine expression by binding to the TAR-like stem loop of the 5' transcript, thus likely promoting the transcriptional elongation (33,37,47).
('Tat', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-6'),('Tat', 'Transcription', 'IL-6'),('Tat', 'Gene_expression', 'TNF-alpha'),('Tat', 'Transcription', 'TNF-alpha')

Here, we have shown that the Tat-dependent transcriptional activation of a number of pro-inflammatory genes required the assembly of Tat with p65 at the NF-kappaB enhancer together with the displacement of IkappaB-alpha (Figure 5).
('p65', 'Binding', 'Tat'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'IkappaB-alpha'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'Tat'),('Tat', 'Negative_regulation', 'p65')

Thus, in the set of distinct NF-kappaB-responsive genes, Tat acted as a component of the transcriptional initiation complex, which is consistent with previous reports on Tat promoting the transcription via DNA motifs (72,73).
('Tat', 'Binding', 'Tat')

The evidence that Tat activates NF-kappaB through direct interaction with IkappaB-alpha and p65 may lead to specific inhibitors to counteract the Tat pro-inflammatory action.

The tax protein of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 mediates the transactivation of the c-sis/platelet-derived growth factor-B promoter through interactions with the zinc finger transcription factors Sp1 and NGFI-A/Egr-1.
('tax', 'Positive_regulation', 'c-sis')

Transcriptional up-regulation of the c-sis/platelet-derived growth factor-B (PDGF-B) proto-oncogene by the Tax protein of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 has been implicated as one possible mechanism of cellular transformation by human T-cell leukemia virus type 1.
('Tax', 'Transcription', 'c-sis')

In previous work, we identified an essential site in the c-sis/PDGF-B promoter, Tax-responsive element 1 (TRE1), necessary for transactivation by Tax.
('Tax', 'Transcription', 'c-sis')

We also identified Sp1, Sp3, and NGFI-A/Egr-1 as the primary nuclear transcription factors binding to TRE1 which mediate Tax responsiveness.
('Tax', 'Binding', 'Sp1'),('Tax', 'Binding', 'NGFI-A')

In the present work, we have investigated the mechanism(s) whereby Tax transactivates the c-sis/PDGF-B proto-oncogene.
('Tax', 'Transcription', 'c-sis')

In vitro transcription assays showed that Tax was able to significantly increase the transcriptional activity of a template containing the -257 to +74 region of the c-sis/PDGF-B promoter.
('Tax', 'Transcription', 'c-sis')

Electrophoretic mobility shift assay analysis showed that Tax increased the DNA binding activity of both Sp1 and NGFI-A/Egr-1 using a TRE1 probe.
('Tax', 'Binding', 'Sp1'),('Tax', 'Binding', 'NGFI-A')

Analysis of Tax mutants showed that two mutants, IEXC29S and IEXL320G, were unable to significantly transactivate the c-sis/PDGF-B promoter.
('Tax', 'Transcription', 'c-sis')

Finally, co-immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that Tax is able to stably bind to both Sp1 and NGFI-A/Egr-1.
('Tax', 'Binding', 'Sp1'),('Tax', 'Binding', 'NGFI-A')

Interestingly, co-immunoprecipitation analysis also revealed that Tax mutant IEXC29S is unable to interact with NGFI-A/Egr-1, whereas Tax mutant IEXL320G is able to interact with NGFI-A/Egr-1.
('Tax', 'Binding', 'NGFI-A')

Luciferase assays revealed a ~20-fold increased transcriptional activity of the 1025 bp sequence as compared to the empty vector, indicating that we had identified an active A3G promoter sequence (Figure 3B).

Thrombin and thrombin receptor agonist peptide induce early events of T cell activation and synergize with TCR cross-linking for CD69 expression and interleukin 2 production.
('Thrombin', 'Gene_expression', 'CD69'),('Thrombin', 'Gene_expression', 'interleukin 2')

Tat activates the p65-dependent expression of NF-kappaB-responsive genes by occupying the NF-kappaB enhancers and promoting the p65 recruitment with IkappaB-alpha displacement.
('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65')

HeLa cells (5 x 106) were transfected with p3xFLAG-Tat, p3xFLAG-Tat C(22,25,27), p3xFLAG-Tat R(49-57) or empty vector (10 microg); for p65 RNA interference, cells (5 x 106) were transfected with p3xFLAG-Tat (10 microg) and siRNA p65 or siRNA control (200 pmol).
('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65')

(H) HeLa cells (5 x 106) were transfected with p3xFLAG-Tat, or empty vector (10 microg) and 48 h later ChIP was performed with anti-p65 antibody.
('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65')

(I) HeLa cells (5 x 106) were transfected with empty vector, or p3xFLAG-Tat (10 microg) in presence or absence of siRNA p65, or siRNA control (200 pmol); 48 h later, ChIP was performed with anti-FLAG antibody.
('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65')

Indeed, when Tax is coexpressed with the E2F-1 transcription factor in CEM T-cells, which lack expression of p16(INK4A), it strongly potentiates the E2F-dependent activation of a reporter construct driven by a promoter containing E2F binding sites.
('Tax', 'Transcription', 'E2F-1')

In addition, Tax also stimulates the transcription of the E2F-1 gene itself.
('Tax', 'Transcription', 'E2F-1')

Using Tax mutants that fail to activate either ATF- or NF-kappaB-dependent promoters and different 5' truncation mutants of the E2F-1 promoter, we show that the Tax-dependent transcriptional control of the E2F1 gene involves, at least in part, the ATF binding site located in the E2F-1 promoter.
('Tax', 'Transcription', 'E2F-1')

Extracellular-regulated kinase 1/2, Jun N-terminal kinase, and c-Jun are involved in NF-kappa B-dependent IL-6 expression in human monocytes.
('c-Jun', 'Transcription', 'IL-6')

In the present study we investigated the possible involvement of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family members extracellular-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) in mediating IL-6 gene expression in human monocytes, in particular their role in enhancing NF-kappa B activity.
('c-Jun', 'Transcription', 'IL-6'),('JNK', 'Phosphorylation', 'c-Jun')

By using PD98059, we demonstrated that the Raf1/MEK1/ERK1/2 pathway did not affect the DNA binding of NF-kappa B but, rather, acted at the level of transcriptional activity of NF-kappa B. Interestingly, it was shown that NF-kappa B-mediated gene transcription, both in the context of the IL-6 promoter as well as on its own, was dependent on both serine kinase activity and interaction with c-Jun protein.
('c-Jun', 'Transcription', 'IL-6')

Our results suggest that the JNK pathway may regulate NF-kappa B-mediated gene transcription through its phosphorylation and activation of c-Jun.

Functional inactivation of Foxp3 by genetic mutations affecting the Foxp3 coding region, as demonstrated in IPEX, or repression of Foxp3 expression by the HTLV-I-encoded transactivator protein Tax, as recently reported in patients with HAM/TSP, results in loss of regulatory activity in CD4+CD25hi T cells [4,8,17].
('Foxp3', 'Localization', 'Foxp3'),('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'Foxp3'),('Foxp3', 'Negative_regulation', 'Foxp3'),('Tax', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3')

Although it is clear that Foxp3 regulates T cell proliferation and cytokine production, very little is known concerning the molecular mechanisms of Foxp3 function.
('Foxp3', 'Localization', 'Foxp3'),('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'Foxp3'),('Foxp3', 'Negative_regulation', 'Foxp3')

The first evidence to indicate how Foxp3 promotes the development and function of regulatory T cells came from a report by Ziegler and colleagues [16], which suggested that Foxp3 could inhibit transcriptional activation by physically interacting with forkhead binding sites located immediately adjacent to critical cis-acting NF-AT binding sites found in various cytokine promoters (e.g., IL-2 promoter).
('Foxp3', 'Localization', 'Foxp3'),('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'Foxp3'),('Foxp3', 'Negative_regulation', 'Foxp3'),('Foxp3', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-2')

A recent study by Bettelli and colleagues [15] further demonstrated that Foxp3 could inhibit NF-AT as well as NF-kappaB activation, although the mechanism of suppression was shown to involve direct protein-protein interactions between NF-AT or NF-kappaB and Foxp3 rather than binding of Foxp3 to promoter elements adjacent to cis-acting NF-AT or NF-kappaB sites.
('Foxp3', 'Localization', 'Foxp3'),('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'Foxp3'),('Foxp3', 'Negative_regulation', 'Foxp3')

In the present study, we expanded upon these observations by defining additional requirements of Foxp3-mediated repression of NF-kappaB activation, and investigated whether Foxp3 could target additional signaling pathways by examining transcriptional activation of NF-kappaB-dependent and NF-kappaB-independent retroviral pathogens.
('Foxp3', 'Localization', 'Foxp3'),('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'Foxp3'),('Foxp3', 'Negative_regulation', 'Foxp3')

The characterization of the molecular targets of Foxp3 and the mechanism(s) utilized by Foxp3 to support Treg development and function will aid in our understanding of the role Tregs play in the pathogenesis of human autoimmune disease.

Addition of phosphorothioate oligonucleotides that contained the octamer consensus to Jurkat T leukemia cells inhibited interleukin-2 (IL-2) secretion to a degree similar to that observed with a mutated octamer site in the IL-2 enhancer.

Overexpression of HSF2-beta inhibits hemin-induced heat shock gene expression and erythroid differentiation in K562 cells.
('HSF2-beta', 'Positive_regulation', 'HSF2')

Previous studies revealed that HSF2 consists of two alternatively spliced isoforms, HSF2-alpha and HSF2-beta, whose relative abundance is developmentally regulated and varies between different tissues.
('HSF2-beta', 'Positive_regulation', 'HSF2'),('HSF2-alpha', 'Positive_regulation', 'HSF2')

To investigate whether the molar ratio of HSF2-alpha and HSF2-beta isoforms is crucial for the activation of HSF2 and whether the HSF2 isoforms play functionally distinct roles during the hemin-mediated erythroid differentiation, we generated cell clones expressing different levels of HSF2-alpha and HSF2-beta.
('HSF2-beta', 'Positive_regulation', 'HSF2'),('HSF2-alpha', 'Positive_regulation', 'HSF2')

We show that in parental K562 cells, the HSF2-alpha isoform is predominantly expressed and HSF2 can be activated upon hemin treatment.
('HSF2-alpha', 'Positive_regulation', 'HSF2')

In contrast, when HSF2-beta is expressed at levels exceeding those of endogenous HSF2-alpha, the hemin-induced DNA binding activity and transcription of heat shock genes are repressed, whereas overexpression of HSF2-alpha results in an enhanced hemin response.
('HSF2-beta', 'Positive_regulation', 'HSF2'),('HSF2-alpha', 'Positive_regulation', 'HSF2')

Furthermore, the hemin-induced accumulation of globin, known as a marker of erythroid differentiation, is decreased in cells overexpressing HSF2-beta.
('HSF2-beta', 'Positive_regulation', 'HSF2')

We suggest that HSF2-beta acts as a negative regulator of HSF2 activity during hemin-mediated erythroid differentiation of K562 cells.
('HSF2-beta', 'Positive_regulation', 'HSF2')

GABP factors bind to a distal interleukin 2 (IL-2) enhancer and contribute to c-Raf-mediated increase in IL-2 induction.
('c-Raf', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-2')

We show here that c-Raf, which is at the helm of the classic MAP-Erk cascade, contributes to IL-2 induction through a distal enhancer element spanning the nucleotides from positions -502 to -413 in front of the transcriptional start site of the IL-2 gene.
('c-Raf', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-2')

In conjunction with previously published data on c-Raf-induced phosphorylation of GABP factors (E.Flory, A. Hoffmeyer, U.Smola, U.R.Rapp, and J.T.Bruder, J.Virol.70:2260- 2268, 1996), these results indicate a contribution of GABP factors to the Raf-mediated enhancement of IL-2 induction during T-cell activation.

The Transactivation Functions of HTLV-I Tax Are Suppressed by Foxp3
('Foxp3', 'Transcription', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

Since the HTLV-I Tax protein can function at multiple levels in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus to stimulate activation of NF-kappaB [28,29], we hypothesized that overexpression of Foxp3 may interfere with this process.
('Foxp3', 'Transcription', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

However, since Tax-dependent HTLV-I gene expression is independent of NF-kappaB [18], we also hypothesized that Foxp3 would not affect Tax-dependent activation of the HTLV-I LTR.
('Foxp3', 'Transcription', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

To test these hypotheses, we overexpressed HTLV-I Tax, full-length Foxp3, and/or DeltaFKH in HEK 293T cells cotransfected with an HTLV-I LTR or NF-kappaB reporter vector.
('DeltaFKH', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Transcription', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

Interestingly, overexpression of Foxp3, but not DeltaFKH, suppressed Tax-mediated activation of NF-kappaB-dependent transcription.
('DeltaFKH', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Transcription', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

These observations further suggest that the carboxyl-terminal FKH domain is required for inhibiting activation of NF-kappaB in the presence of Tax in HEK 293T cells, strikingly similar to the requirements of Foxp3 inhibition of basal NF-kappaB activation shown in Figure 2B.
('Foxp3', 'Transcription', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

Transactivation of the HTLV-I LTR was stimulated about 55-fold by overexpression of Tax (Figure 4B), while transfection of Foxp3 suppressed Tax-dependent HTLV-I LTR activation, although HTLV-I LTR activation in the presence or absence of Tax is independent of NF-kappaB or NF-AT (another transcriptional activator known to interact with Foxp3).
('Foxp3', 'Transcription', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

Furthermore, overexpression of DeltaFKH also led to suppression of HTLV-I transactivation by Tax to a similar extent as full-length Foxp3 (Figure 4B).
('DeltaFKH', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Transcription', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

The suppressive effects shown in Figure 4A and 4B were not the result of Foxp3 down-regulating the expression of the transfected Tax plasmid as determined by real-time RT-PCR (Figure 4C).
('Foxp3', 'Transcription', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

These results strongly suggest that Foxp3 interacts with transcriptional regulators in addition to NF-kappaB and NF-AT, and that the carboxyl-terminal FKH domain, and therefore localization to the nucleus, are not required for inhibition of Tax-mediated HTLV-I LTR activation (even in HEK 293T cells).
('Foxp3', 'Transcription', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

To determine whether Foxp3 inhibited the transactivation functions of Tax by directly associating with this viral protein, we generated an expression vector in which HTLV-I Tax was fused in-frame to the carboxyl terminus of the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (Gal4-BD).
('Foxp3', 'Transcription', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

Transactivation of the Gal4-resposive promoter by Gal4-BD-Tax remained relatively unaffected by overexpression of either EGFP (control), Foxp3, or DeltaFKH, suggesting that Foxp3 does not repress Tax transactivation by directly interfacing with the HTLV-I Tax protein.
('DeltaFKH', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Transcription', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

As illustrated in Figure 5, the level of Tax mRNA synthesized from ACH was down-regulated in the presence of Foxp3 compared to the level produced in the presence of the control vector.
('Foxp3', 'Transcription', 'Tax'),('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

DeltaFKH did not have a discernable affect on Tax expression.
('DeltaFKH', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

These data indicate that Foxp3 is capable of repressing the expression of Tax from an infectious HTLV-I molecular clone.

Unlike published studies with pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate, which specifically inhibited vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), NAC inhibited IL-1 beta-induced mRNA and cell surface expression of both E-selectin and VCAM-1.

Itk, a T cell-specific tyrosine kinase, is required for CD2-mediated interleukin-2 promoter activation in the human T cell line Jurkat.
('Itk', 'Positive_regulation', 'interleukin-2'),('CD2', 'Phosphorylation', 'Itk')

Stimulation of either CD2 or T cell receptor (TCR)/CD3 on Tcells by monoclonal antibody-mediated cross-linking induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Itk, which was maximal as early as 1 min after stimulation.
('CD2', 'Phosphorylation', 'Itk')

Interleukin-2 (IL-2) promoter activity stimulated by cross-linking of CD2, TCR/CD3, and CD28 with antibodies was significantly reduced by transient expression of an Itk mutant lacking the kinase activity.
('CD2', 'Positive_regulation', 'CD2'),('CD28', 'Positive_regulation', 'Interleukin-2'),('CD2', 'Phosphorylation', 'Itk'),('Itk', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2'),('CD2', 'Positive_regulation', 'Interleukin-2'),('Itk', 'Positive_regulation', 'Interleukin-2')

These results demonstrate that Itk plays a role in IL-2 production, indicating a critical involvement of Itk in the initial stage of T cell activation by mediating signals from the TCR/CD3 complex, CD2, and CD28.
('CD2', 'Positive_regulation', 'CD2'),('CD2', 'Phosphorylation', 'Itk'),('Itk', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2')

Consistent with these findings the dominant negative PKCalpha constructs also inhibited NF-kappaB p65 phosphorylation at Ser276 but not at Ser536 resulting in reduced NF-kappaB transcriptional activation and M-CSF-induced MDM survival.
('PKCalpha', 'Phosphorylation', 'p65'),('dominant negative PKCalpha', 'Phosphorylation', 'p65')

Finally, in a NF-kappaB p65-/- fibroblast cell line, we confirmed that the Ser276 residue of NF-kappaB p65 is important and essential for PKC modulation of NF-kappaB activity.
('p65', 'Binding', 'p65'),('p65', 'Positive_regulation', 'p65')

Notably, in addition to phosphorylating Ser276 of NF-kappaB, our study revealed that M-CSF also modulated the phosphorylation of the NF-kappaB p65 subunit at Ser536, however, PKC inhibitors or kinase deficient PKCalpha constructs did not affect this phosphorylation event.
('PKCalpha', 'Phosphorylation', 'p65')

Moreover, mutant constructs containing a point mutation at Ser536 of NF-kappaB p65 did not reduce NF-kappaB activity in cells lacking endogenous NF-kappaB p65, while the NF-kappaB p65 276S/A construct did reduce NF-kappaB activity in these cells.
('p65', 'Binding', 'p65'),('p65', 'Positive_regulation', 'p65')

It is notable that M-CSF activated NF-kappaB p65 Ser276 phosphorylation and transcriptional activation in a PKCalpha-dependent manner.
('PKCalpha', 'Phosphorylation', 'p65')

In our studies using conventional PKC inhibitors and dominant negative PKCalpha constructs, PKCalpha was critical in M-CSF-induced macrophage survival by inducing Ser276 phosphorylation of NF-kappaB p65 in both primary human MDMs and Raw 264.7 cells.
('PKCalpha', 'Phosphorylation', 'p65'),('dominant negative PKCalpha', 'Phosphorylation', 'p65')

It has been shown that phosphorylation of p65 at Ser276 prevents its degradation by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis and promotes cell survival in HeLa cells [24].
('ubiquitin', 'Protein_catabolism', 'p65')

We did not find that PKC was involved in IkappaBalpha degradation or NF-kappaB p65 nuclear translocation induced by M-CSF, but that M-CSF-induced phosphorylation of NF-kappaB p65 at Ser276 was dramatically reduced by the conventional PKC inhibitor and kinase deficient PKCalpha and by siRNA towards PKCalpha.
('p65', 'Binding', 'p65'),('PKCalpha', 'Phosphorylation', 'p65'),('p65', 'Positive_regulation', 'p65')

During this process, expression of IKKalpha among other proteins, is elevated leading to increased p52 NF-kappaB (relB) expression through partial proteolytic degradation of the p100 NF-kappaB protein.

Functional roles of the transcription factor Oct-2A and the high mobility group protein I/Y in HLA-DRA gene expression.
('I/Y', 'Binding', 'Oct-2A')

Here we show that the lymphoid-specific transcription factor Oct-2A plays a critical role in HLA-DRA gene expression in class II-positive B cell lines, and that the high mobility group protein (HMG) I/Y binds to multiple sites within the DRA promoter, including the Oct-2A binding site.
('I/Y', 'Binding', 'Oct-2A')

Coexpression of HMG I/Y and Oct-2 in cell lines lacking Oct-2 results in high levels of HLA-DRA gene expression, and in vitro DNA-binding studies reveal that HMG I/Y stimulates Oct-2A binding to the HLA-DRA promoter.
('I/Y', 'Binding', 'Oct-2A')

Thus, Oct-2A and HMG I/Y may synergize to activate HLA-DRA expression in B cells.
('I/Y', 'Binding', 'Oct-2A')

By contrast, Oct-2A is not involved in the IFN-gamma induction of the HLA-DRA gene in HeLa cells, but antisense HMG I/Y dramatically decreases the level of induction.
('I/Y', 'Binding', 'Oct-2A')

Transcriptional regulation of lysosomal acid lipase in differentiating monocytes is mediated by transcription factors Sp1 and AP-2.
('Sp1', 'Regulation', 'lysosomal acid lipase')

Gel mobility shift assays demonstrated that binding of Sp1 and AP-2 to the LAL promoter is increased by PMA in THP-1 cells.
('Sp1', 'Gene_expression', 'LAL')

Co-transfections with expression plasmids for Sp1 and AP-2 further emphasized the important role of these transcription factors in both basal and PMA-enhanced LAL expression.
('Sp1', 'Gene_expression', 'LAL')

Our data suggest that differentiation dependent increase of lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) expression in THP-1 cells is mediated by a concerted action of Sp1 and AP-2.

PPARgamma activation induces the expression of the adipocyte fatty acid binding protein gene in human monocytes.
('PPARgamma', 'Gene_expression', 'adipocyte fatty acid binding protein')

PPARgamma induces the expression of many genes involved in lipid anabolism, including the adipocyte fatty acid binding protein (aP2), and is a key regulator of adipocyte differentiation.
('PPARgamma', 'Gene_expression', 'adipocyte fatty acid binding protein'),('PPARgamma', 'Gene_expression', 'aP2')

We report that both natural and synthetic PPARgamma agonists induce time- and dose-dependent increases in aP2 mRNA in both primary human monocytes and the monocytic cell line, THP-1.
('PPARgamma', 'Gene_expression', 'aP2')

The mutant, containing a serine-to-alanine substitution in the DNA-binding domain of the protein, bound to several known ZEBRA-binding sites and activated transcription from reporters bearing known ZEBRA-responsive promoters but did not disrupt latency in EBV-infected cell lines.
('ZEBRA', 'Binding', 'ZEBRA')

Therefore, initiation of the EBV lytic cycle by the ZEBRA protein requires a function in addition to transcriptional activation; a change of serine 186 to alanine in the DNA-binding domain of ZEBRA abolished this additional function and uncovered a new role for the ZEBRA protein in disruption of EBV latency.

CD40 expression was confirmed in 7 human MM cell lines established from immunogenic primary tumors or metastases, whereas 11 cell lines established from advanced stages were CD40 negative.
('CD40', 'Gene_expression', 'CD40')

CD40 ligation on MM by CD40L-transfected murine L-cells or by a soluble CD40L fusion protein up-regulated their expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and MHC class I and class II molecules and their secretion of IL-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor-a, and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor and also induced a rapid activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappaB.

Runx3 controls multiple aspects of the CTL differentiation program, in part through induction of Eomes
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'Eomes'),('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'Eomes')

Strikingly, Runx3-/- CD8+ T cells were strongly impaired in their ability to differentiate into effector CTLs, as judged by expression of perforin, granzyme B, and IFN-gamma (Fig.
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'granzyme B'),('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'granzyme B'),('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'perforin')

Compared with WT T cells, perforin mRNA and protein expression were essentially undetectable in Runx3-/- T cells at day 6 of culture (Fig.
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'perforin')

Runx3-/- T cells also had no detectable Eomes expression; in contrast, T-bet expression was unimpaired (Fig.
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'Eomes'),('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'Eomes')

Furthermore, Runx3 was required for maximal production of IFN-gamma, but not TNF or IL-2, by CD8+ T cells restimulated at day 6 (Fig.
('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'TNF')

We previously reported that Th1 cell differentiation was regulated through a feed-forward loop in which T-bet is up-regulated early and induces Runx3, after which T-bet and Runx3 cooperate to induce IFN-gamma and silence IL-4, thus promoting stable differentiation toward the Th1 lineage (15, 22).
('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma')

Because (a) Runx3 appeared necessary for Eomes induction (Fig.

3 A), (b) the kinetics of Eomes expression paralleled those of perforin expression (Fig.
('Eomes', 'Transcription', 'perforin'),('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin')

2), and (c) overexpression of Eo-VP16 in either WT or T-bet-deficient T cells led to an increase in both perforin and IFN-gamma expression (Fig.
('Eo-VP16', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin')

Specifically, we asked whether Runx3, which was necessary for Eomes induction, then cooperated with Eomes to regulate transcription of the effector CTL markers perforin, IFN-gamma, and granzyme B.
('Eomes', 'Transcription', 'IFN-gamma'),('Eomes', 'Transcription', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'granzyme B'),('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'Eomes'),('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'Eomes'),('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'granzyme B'),('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'granzyme B'),('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'perforin'),('Eomes', 'Transcription', 'granzyme B')

To test this hypothesis, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays to ask whether Eomes and Runx3 bound regulatory regions of the Prf1, Ifng, and Gzmb genes (Fig.
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'Eomes'),('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'Eomes')

Runx3 bound to the Prf1 and Gzmb transcription start sites (TSS); to a known IL-2 responsive enhancer located near -1 kb of the Prf1 gene (23); to the distal CTL-specific DNase I hypersensitive site 9 in the Prf1 locus (24); to the Ifng promoter near the TSS, as previously reported for Th1 cells (10); and to several DNase I hypersensitive sites in the Ifng locus (Fig.
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2')

To determine whether Runx3 controlled the expression of CTL effector genes through its induction of Eomes, we retrovirally expressed Runx3 and Eo-VP16 in CD8+ T cells from Runx3-/- mice.
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'Eomes'),('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'Eomes')

Reconstitution of Runx3-/- CD8+ T cells with Runx3 restored expression of Eomes as well as perforin, granzyme B, and IFN-gamma (Fig.
('Eomes', 'Transcription', 'IFN-gamma'),('Eomes', 'Transcription', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'granzyme B'),('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'Eomes'),('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'Eomes'),('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'granzyme B'),('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'granzyme B'),('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'perforin'),('Eomes', 'Transcription', 'granzyme B')

Notably, Eo-VP16 did not up-regulate perforin expression when expressed in Runx3-/- cells, even though it restored the capacity to induce IFN-gamma expression upon TCR restimulation (Fig.
('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'IFN-gamma'),('Eo-VP16', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'perforin')

This result suggests strongly that perforin expression requires Runx3 and Eomes.
('Eomes', 'Transcription', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'Eomes'),('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'Eomes'),('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'perforin')

As expected from their defect in perforin and granzyme B expression, Runx3-/- CD8+ T cells showed defective cytolytic activity in a mixed lymphocyte reaction (12).
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'granzyme B'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'granzyme B'),('Runx3', 'Transcription', 'perforin')

Therefore, although activation of the perforin/granzyme B machinery is defective in Runx3-/- CD8+ cells, these cells are not entirely devoid of cytolytic activity and could still effectively kill targets, possibly by alternative mechanisms such as the Fas-Fas ligand pathway.

Using an in vitro competition assay (Figure 4A) utilizing purified activated GATA-3, importin-alpha, and activated GR, we demonstrated that activated GR significantly increased GR-importin-alpha association in the presence and absence of activated GATA-3 (Figure 4B).
('GR', 'Localization', 'GATA-3'),('GR', 'Binding', 'GR'),('GATA-3', 'Binding', 'GR'),('GR', 'Binding', 'GATA-3')

This effect is not mutual, since activated GATA-3 did not block GR-importin-alpha association (Figure 4C).
('GR', 'Localization', 'GATA-3'),('GATA-3', 'Binding', 'GR'),('GR', 'Binding', 'GATA-3')

These data also suggest that both activated GR and phospho-GATA-3 can directly associate with importin-alpha (Figure 4D) and that activated GR attenuates the phospho-GATA-3/importin-alpha interaction in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 4E).
('GR', 'Localization', 'GATA-3'),('GR', 'Binding', 'GR'),('GATA-3', 'Binding', 'GR'),('GR', 'Binding', 'GATA-3')

Together, this suggests that ligand-activated GR may compete with phospho-GATA-3 for importin-alpha and thereby limit GATA-3 nuclear import.
('GR', 'Localization', 'GATA-3'),('GATA-3', 'Binding', 'GR'),('GR', 'Binding', 'GATA-3')

Nor did addition of FP subsequent to anti-CD3/CD28 nuclear translocation affect GATA-3 nuclear residency (Figure 5C), suggesting that activated GR does not enhance GATA-3 nuclear export.
('GR', 'Localization', 'GATA-3'),('GATA-3', 'Binding', 'GR'),('GR', 'Binding', 'GATA-3')

Using this system, we observed that CD28 stimulation by B7-transfected CHO cells induced a proliferative response in T cells that was not accompanied by measurable IL-2 production.
('CD28', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2')

In contrast, engagement of the TCR by class II MHC/superantigen, either with or without CD28 ligation, resulted in the induction of NF-AT, AP-1, and NF-kappaB as well as IL-2 production.
('CD28', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2')

Perforin and granzyme B expression are not appreciably regulated by T-bet
('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'granzyme B'),('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'Perforin')

To test the model outlined in the previous paragraph directly, we compared the expression of IFN-gamma, perforin, and granzyme B in CD8+ T cells from WT and Tbx21 (T-bet)-deficient mice.
('T-bet', 'Transcription', 'perforin'),('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'granzyme B'),('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma')

In contrast, T-bet-deficient T cells cultured for 6 d showed no defect in perforin mRNA expression (Fig.
('T-bet', 'Transcription', 'perforin')

We consistently observed a modest reduction in GzmB mRNA in T-bet-deficient T cells (Fig.
('T-bet', 'Transcription', 'GzmB'),('T-bet', 'Negative_regulation', 'GzmB')

Eo-VP16, but not the empty GFP retrovirus, increased perforin expression in both WT and T-bet-deficient CD8+ T cells (Fig.
('T-bet', 'Transcription', 'perforin'),('Eo-VP16', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin')

As expected, Eo-VP16 also rescued the early defect in IFN-gamma production observed in T-bet-deficient CD8+ T cells (Fig.
('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma')

However, Eo-VP16 did not induce GzmB mRNA expression in either WT or T-bet-deficient cells; thus, the partial T-bet dependence of GzmB mRNA expression cannot be compensated for by Eo-VP16.

IKKbeta phosphorylates RPS3 at serine 209
('IKKbeta', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3')

We therefore hypothesized that IKKbeta could directly phosphorylate RPS3.
('IKKbeta', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3')

By in vitro kinase assays using recombinant IKK and RPS3 proteins, we observed strong incorporation of 32P in autophosphorylatd IKKalpha and IKKbeta (Fig.
('IKKbeta', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3')

We discovered that GST-RPS3 could be phosphorylated by IKKbeta, but not IKKalpha, in vitro (Fig.
('IKKbeta', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3')

To identify the RPS3 amino acid residue(s) phosphorylated by IKKbeta, we performed liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analyses using in vitro phosphorylated RPS3.
('IKKbeta', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('RPS3', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3')

The results indicated that IKKbeta phosphorylated S209, located in the RPS3 C-terminus (Fig.
('IKKbeta', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3')

To verify biochemically that S209 is an IKKbeta substrate, we performed 32P-labeling in vitro kinase assays with recombinant wild-type or S209A mutant RPS3 proteins.
('IKKbeta', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3')

Compared with the wild-type protein, the S209A mutation reduced IKKbeta-mediated RPS3 phosphorylation (Fig.
('IKKbeta', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3')

Thus, RPS3 S209 phosphorylation was due to the alternate specificity of the IKKbeta kinase rather than any trace amount of CK2 bound to IKKs.
('IKKbeta', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3')

To determine whether S209 is the critical site at which IKKbeta phosphorylates RPS3 in living cells, we transfected the wild-type or S209A mutant Flag-RPS3 alone, or together with IKKbeta into cells.
('IKKbeta', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('RPS3', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('IKKbeta', 'Phosphorylation', 'Flag-RPS3')

Indeed, we observed that overexpressing IKKbeta enhanced Flag-RPS3 phosphorylation, but phosphorylation was effectively eliminated by alanine substitution indicating that S209 is the predominant target site for IKKbeta phosphorylation (Fig.
('IKKbeta', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('IKKbeta', 'Phosphorylation', 'Flag-RPS3')

We next generated a phospho-S209 RPS3 antibody and confirmed that endogenous RPS3 was phosphorylated at S209 in a time-dependent manner upon TNF stimulation (Fig.
('RPS3', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3')

HOIP is necessary for association of the IKK complex with CD40
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40')

The marked defects in CD40-mediated cell activation and signaling displayed by HOIP-deficient cells suggested that HOIP mediates recruitment of critical components of the CD40 signaling apparatus to the receptor.
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40')

Previously, we demonstrated that HOIP is recruited to the CD40 signaling complex in a TRAF2-dependent manner, suggesting that HOIP functions downstream of TRAF2 [6].
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40'),('HOIP', 'Binding', 'TRAF2'),('TRAF2', 'Binding', 'HOIP')

Studies by others suggest that the TRAF2-associated proteins cIAP1 and cIAP2 play a role in the recruitment of HOIP to TNFR1 and CD40 [14].
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'cIAP1'),('cIAP2', 'Binding', 'HOIP'),('cIAP1', 'Binding', 'HOIP'),('cIAP', 'Binding', 'HOIP'),('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40'),('HOIP', 'Binding', 'TRAF2'),('TRAF2', 'Binding', 'HOIP'),('cIAP', 'Protein_modification', 'HOIP')

Therefore, we determined whether the association of HOIP with CD40 in A20.2J cells was altered by treatment of cells with an inhibitor of cIAP activity, a membrane-permeable peptide derived from the apoptosis regulator SMAC [15].
('cIAP', 'Binding', 'HOIP'),('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40'),('cIAP', 'Protein_modification', 'HOIP')

SMAC peptide treatment also resulted in a slight but reproducible decrease in the amount of the major HOIP form recovered by CD40 immunoprecipitation, along with an apparent increase in higher molecular weight species recognized by anti-HOIP antibody.
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40')

These data suggest that SMAC peptide treatment specifically alters the characteristics of CD40-associated HOIP rather than the entire cellular pool of this protein.
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40')

Together, these results support the idea that the cIAP proteins influence the recruitment and post-translational modification state of CD40-associated HOIP.
('cIAP', 'Binding', 'HOIP'),('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40'),('cIAP', 'Protein_modification', 'HOIP')

To test the possibility that HOIP is responsible for the recruitment of other critical signaling proteins to CD40, we immunoprecipitated CD40 signaling complexes from HOIP-deficient and HOIP-reconstituted cells (Fig.
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40')

As described previously, CD40 signaling complexes immunoprecipitated from A20.2J cells contained HOIP as well as TRAF2, TRAF3, IKKalpha/beta, and IKKgamma [6].
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'TRAF3'),('HOIP', 'Binding', 'IKKgamma'),('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40'),('HOIP', 'Binding', 'TRAF2'),('TRAF2', 'Binding', 'HOIP')

The amounts of TRAF2, TRAF3, and cIAP1 in CD40 immunoprecipitates from HOIP-deficient cells were similar to those from parental A20.2J cells, indicating that HOIP is not required for the association of these proteins with CD40.
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'cIAP1'),('HOIP', 'Binding', 'TRAF3'),('cIAP1', 'Binding', 'HOIP'),('cIAP', 'Binding', 'HOIP'),('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40'),('HOIP', 'Binding', 'TRAF2'),('TRAF2', 'Binding', 'HOIP'),('cIAP', 'Protein_modification', 'HOIP')

In contrast, IKKalpha/beta and IKKgamma were not detectable in CD40 immunoprecipitates recovered from HOIP-deficient cells (Fig.
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'IKKgamma'),('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40')

The amounts of IKKalpha/beta and IKKgamma in CD40 immunoprecipitates from HOIP-reconstituted cells were similar to those detected in samples prepared from parental cells, demonstrating that the defects in IKK recruitment we observed were due specifically to the absence of HOIP expression.
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'IKKgamma'),('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40')

These data indicate that HOIP is required for recruitment of the NF-kappaB-activating complex to the CD40 signaling complex.
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40')

To confirm that this higher molecular weight species was indeed IKKgamma, we generated A20.2J cell lines containing a stably integrated retroviral vector that encoded an epitope-tagged version of mouse IKKgamma.
('IKKgamma', 'Protein_modification', 'IKKgamma')

Moreover, analysis of cells expressing epitope tagged-IKKgamma confirmed that recruitment of IKKgamma to CD40 requires HOIP.
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'IKKgamma'),('IKKgamma', 'Protein_modification', 'IKKgamma'),('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40')

Overall, these data demonstrate that HOIP is required for the association of IKKgamma with CD40, and suggest that this event is coupled to post-translational modifications of IKKgamma.
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'IKKgamma'),('IKKgamma', 'Protein_modification', 'IKKgamma'),('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40')

The T-box transcription factors T-bet and Eomes have been linked to the regulation of genes encoding effector cytokines (e.g., Ifng) and genes important for cytolytic function (e.g., Prf1 and GzmB) (20).
('Eomes', 'Regulation', 'Prf1'),('Eomes', 'Regulation', 'Ifng'),('Eomes', 'Regulation', 'GzmB'),('T-bet', 'Regulation', 'GzmB'),('T-bet', 'Regulation', 'Prf1'),('T-bet', 'Regulation', 'Ifng')

T-bet mRNA expression slightly preceded the expression of GzmB mRNA; similarly, Eomes mRNA and protein were expressed approximately1 d ahead of the reexpression of perforin mRNA and protein, respectively (Fig.
('Eomes', 'Regulation', 'GzmB'),('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('T-bet', 'Regulation', 'GzmB')

T-bet is required early for IFN-gamma production, and our data suggested that Eomes might not function during this early period but rather might contribute later to the control of perforin expression.
('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma')

Our data seemed most consistent with a model in which TCR signals induce T-bet, which in turn induces IFN-gamma (17) and possibly granzyme B; subsequently, Eomes is induced during the period of clonal expansion in IL-2 and activates perforin expression.
('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma')

Induction of interleukin-12 p40 transcript by CD40 ligation via activation of nuclear factor-kappaB.
('CD40', 'Positive_regulation', 'p40')

Interleukin-12 is produced in response to infection with bacteria or parasites or to bacterial constituents such as LPS in monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells, and also generated by the interaction between activated T cells and antigen-presenting cells via CD40-CD40 ligand (CD40L).
('CD40', 'Positive_regulation', 'CD40')

In the present study, we have characterized the transcriptional induction of p40 by CD40 ligation in a human B lymphoblastoid cell line, Daudi, and a human acute monocytic leukemia cell line, THP-1.
('CD40', 'Positive_regulation', 'p40')

These cells, stimulated by an agonistic monoclonal antibody against CD40 or by transfection with a CD40L expression vector, secreted p40 and showed enhanced p40 mRNA expression.
('CD40', 'Positive_regulation', 'CD40'),('CD40', 'Positive_regulation', 'p40')

Electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed that the potential NF-kappaB binding sequence which is located around 120 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site in murine and human p40 genes formed an NF-kappaB complex with nuclear extract from Daudi cells stimulated by CD40 ligation.
('CD40', 'Positive_regulation', 'p40')

These results suggest that the NF-kappaB binding site located around 120 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site in murine and human p40 promoter regions could be important for the p40 induction by CD40 ligation via activation of NF-kappaB.
('CD40', 'Positive_regulation', 'p40')

TNFRI has been recently shown to activate NF-kappaB through association with TRADD, RIP, and TRAF2; activation of the NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK); activation of the IkappaB alpha kinases (IKKalpha and IKKbeta); and phosphorylation of IkappaB alpha.

IL-12 and High Doses of Antigen Induce the Development of Th1 Cells Producing IL-10
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Culture of naive CD4+ Tcells in an APC-free system by stimulation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies in the presence of IL-12 resulted in IFN-gamma-producing Th1 cells, a proportion of which coproduced IL-10, as did Th2 cells resulting from culture in IL-4 (FigureS1B).
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma')

To investigate whether the lack of IL-10 produced by Th1 cells resulted from inhibition of IL-10 production by DCs and high antigen dose or alternatively required IL-12, we cultured naive CD4+ Tcells with increasing doses of antigen presented by DC in the presence of IL-12.
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

At low doses of antigen, IL-12 abrogated the development of Th2 cells and induced IFN-gamma expression but only low levels of IL-10 expression, suggesting that IL-12 per se was not sufficient to induce significant IL-10 production in Th1 cells (Figure1A).
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma')

Strikingly, as the antigen dose was increased, Th1 populations driven with IL-12 now contained higher numbers of IL-10-producing cells (Figure1A) and produced more IL-10 protein upon restimulation (Figures 1A and 1B).
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Thus, the development of Th1 cells producing IL-10 required both IL-12 and high doses of antigen.
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Th1 cells differentiated to produce large amounts of IL-10 and IFN-gamma and lost theircapacity to produce IL-2 (Figure1B).
('IL-2', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Because the presence of IL-12 reduced the proliferation of CD4+ Tcells at both high andlow antigen doses (Table S1), and only the former showed IL-10 production, the development of high IL-10-producing cellsis most likely not related to limited IL-2.
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-2', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Naive CD4+ Tcells from DO11.10/recombination-activating gene 1 (Rag1)-deficient animals, cultured with high doses of antigen in the presence of IL-12, also resulted in IL-10 expression by Th1 cells, showing that this expression was not dependent on the presence of effector or memory Tcells or Treg cells (FigureS2).
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Although it has been suggested that TGF-beta can induce IL-10 in CD4+ Tcells (Kitani etal., 2003; Schiott etal., 2000), we found that in developing Th1 and Th2 cells this was not the case (data not shown).
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

In fact, neutralization of TGF-beta led to increased IL-10 production by both Tcell subsets (FigureS3).
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Thus, the development of IL-10-producing Th1 cells only depended on the presence of IL-12 together with high antigen dose and not on other soluble factors such as IL-2 or TGF-beta or on the presence of other Tcell types.

The presence of an active CRE site in the bcl-2 promoter implies that the regulation of bcl-2 expression is linked to a signal transduction pathway in B cells.
('bcl-2', 'Gene_expression', 'bcl-2')

The CRE site in the bcl-2 promoter appears to play a major role in the induction of bcl-2 expression during the activation of mature B cells and during the rescue of immature B cells from apoptosis.
('bcl-2', 'Gene_expression', 'bcl-2')

Furthermore, TIMP-1 upregulation induced expression of Bcl-XL but not Bcl-2 as well as decreased NF-kappaB activity as compared with controls.
('TIMP-1', 'Gene_expression', 'Bcl-XL'),('TIMP-1', 'Gene_expression', 'Bcl-2')

In Rel-/- splenic T cell cultures stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin, the levels of IL-3, IL-5, granulocyte- macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) were only 2- to 3-fold lower compared with normal T cells.
('Rel', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-3'),('Rel', 'Gene_expression', 'GM-CSF')

Exogenous IL-2, which restitutes the proliferative response of the anti-CD3- and anti-CD28-treated Rel-/- T cells, restores production of IL-5, TNF-alpha, and IFN-gamma, but not IL-3 and GM-CSF expression to approximately normal levels.
('IL-2', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-5'),('IL-2', 'Gene_expression', 'GM-CSF'),('IL-2', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-3'),('IL-2', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('Rel', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-3'),('IL-2', 'Gene_expression', 'TNF-alpha'),('Rel', 'Gene_expression', 'GM-CSF')

In contrast to mitogen-activated Rel-/- T cells, lipopolysaccharide-stimulated Rel-/- macrophages produce higher than normal levels of GM-CSF.
('Rel', 'Gene_expression', 'GM-CSF')

These findings establish that Rel can function as an activator or repressor of gene expression and is required by T lymphocytes for production of IL-3 and GM-CSF.
('Rel', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-3'),('Rel', 'Gene_expression', 'GM-CSF')

The current study reveals that FOXP3 induction, an important step in iTreg commitment, is inhibited by GATA3, which is the key regulator for polarization toward Th2 cells.
('GATA3', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Binding', 'FOXP3')

In contrast, naive T cells could efficiently up-regulate FOXP3 when treated with TGF-beta to induce iTreg cells [10,28-34], suggesting that FOXP3 plays an important role in the early differentiation process and may act in a way similar to that known for the Th1/Th2 decision factors T-bet and GATA3.
('GATA3', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'GATA3'),('GATA3', 'Binding', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'T-bet')

In this competitive process TGF-beta appeared to be mandatory for the induction of FOXP3, possibly by keeping the expression of GATA3 and T-bet low [37,38].
('GATA3', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'GATA3'),('GATA3', 'Binding', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'T-bet')

In contrast, differentiating naive T cells in the absence of polarization factors (Th0) such as IL-4, IL-12, or TGF-beta showed only a transient FOXP3 expression and failed to generate a population of FOXP3-expressing cells, but GATA3 and T-bet were up-regulated (unpublished data).
('GATA3', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'GATA3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'GATA3'),('GATA3', 'Binding', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'T-bet')

Interestingly, as we and others previously described, FOXP3-promoting factors, such as dexamethasone [39], CTLA-4 [40], and estrogens [41], are also known as inhibitors of GATA3 expression [42-45].
('GATA3', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('CTLA-4', 'Gene_expression', 'GATA3'),('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Binding', 'FOXP3')

Therefore GATA3 not only induces differentiation into Th2 cells but also inhibits FOXP3 expression and commitment into iTreg cells.
('GATA3', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Binding', 'FOXP3')

The Th2 cytokine IL-4 but not IL-13 (unpublished data) was able to inhibit TGF-beta-mediated FOXP3 induction and therefore prevented conversion into the regulatory phenotype.
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-13', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

Only the IL-4/IL-4 mAb complex resulted in a decrease of the amount of natural or inducible Treg (CD25+ and Foxp3+) cells 7 d after treatment.
('CD25', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3')

But since a distinction of nTreg and iTreg cells is currently not possible, because iTreg cells also transiently express CD25 after activation, we cannot exclude that IL-4 may also inhibit Foxp3 expression in nTreg cells in vivo or that additional effects may contribute to the observed drop in Foxp3 expression.
('CD25', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3')

IL-4 has been previously shown to induce the generation of FOXP3+ Treg cells out of CD4+CD25- [50].
('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

In those experiments, the concentrations of IL-4 used were low, and as we also observed, IL-4 at low concentration slightly enhanced FOXP3 expression.
('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

IL-4 may favor proliferation of nTreg cells [47] or directly regulate FOXP3 expression in a STAT-dependent fashion [51].
('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

Since IL-13 does not effectively reduce FOXP3 and fails to induce GATA3, we hypothesized that the IL-4-dependent inhibition of FOXP3 could be mediated by GATA3.
('GATA3', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'GATA3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Binding', 'FOXP3'),('IL-13', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

In fact, GATA3-inducing IL-4 concentrations repressed TGF-beta-mediated FOXP3 expression, whereas IL-4 as well as TGF-beta signaling were intact.
('GATA3', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'GATA3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'GATA3'),('GATA3', 'Binding', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

This result suggested a competitive mechanism between GATA3 and FOXP3 transcription factors in determining lineage commitment during the early phase of differentiation.
('GATA3', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Binding', 'FOXP3')

Accordingly, we investigated naturally high GATA3-expressing cells and confirmed the absence of FOXP3.
('GATA3', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Binding', 'FOXP3')

Protein transduction of GATA3 into naive T cells inhibited FOXP3 induction in human, differentiating, naive T cells.
('GATA3', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Binding', 'FOXP3')

In line with the transient overexpression of GATA3 in human T cells, cells of these mice failed to induce FOXP3 expression upon exposure with antigen in the presence of TGF-beta.
('GATA3', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'GATA3'),('GATA3', 'Binding', 'FOXP3')

Strikingly, the DO11.10:CD2-GATA3 mice do have peripheral FOXP3+ cells, which however displayed a 10%-25% lower frequency compared to wild-type DO11.10 mice.
('GATA3', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Binding', 'FOXP3')

Our study demonstrates that GATA3 repressed FOXP3 expression directly by binding to the FOXP3 promoter region.
('GATA3', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Binding', 'FOXP3')

Therefore keeping GATA3 expression low might be required to induce efficient FOXP3+ iTreg cell generation.
('GATA3', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Binding', 'FOXP3')

The molecular interactions enabling GATA3 to inhibit FOXP3 are not identified yet, but the GATA-binding site is located adjacent to positive, inducing sites, composed of AP-1-NFATc2 sites [24], and GATA3 may compete with the binding of AP-1/NFAT to the promoter (unpublished observations).
('GATA3', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Binding', 'FOXP3')

In summary, we demonstrated that FOXP3 is negatively regulated by cytokines such as IL-4.
('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

GATA3 acts as an inhibitor of FOXP3 expression in early T cell differentiation, as well as in differentiated Th2 cells by directly binding and repressing the FOXP3 promoter.
('GATA3', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Binding', 'FOXP3')

We therefore describe a new mechanism of how Il-4 avoids tolerance induction by repressing FOXP3 expression.
('Il-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

We hypothesized that IL-10 prevents human monocyte NF-kappaB activation and resultant TNF-alpha production by stabilization of IkappaB-alpha.
('IL-10', 'Protein_catabolism', 'IkappaB-alpha'),('IL-10', 'Gene_expression', 'TNF-alpha')

The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of IL-10 on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced human monocyte TNF-alpha production, NF-kappaB activation, and IkappaB-alpha degradation.
('IL-10', 'Protein_catabolism', 'IkappaB-alpha'),('IL-10', 'Gene_expression', 'TNF-alpha')

IL-10 attenuated LPS-stimulated TNF-alpha production (297+/-54; p < .001 versus LPS alone).
('IL-10', 'Gene_expression', 'TNF-alpha')

IL-10 pretreatment prevented LPS-induced decreases in IkappaB-alpha protein levels and attenuated NF-kappaB DNA binding.
('IL-10', 'Protein_catabolism', 'IkappaB-alpha')

IL-10 appears to prevent activation of NF-kappaB by preserving IkappaB-alpha protein levels, leading to a reduction in TNF-alpha release.
('IL-10', 'Protein_catabolism', 'IkappaB-alpha'),('IL-10', 'Gene_expression', 'TNF-alpha')

DNA-binding properties of HIV-TF1 suggested that HIV-TF1 might be identical or related to USF.
('HIV-TF1', 'Binding', 'HIV-TF1')

Interestingly, treatment of purified HIV-TF1 by phosphatase greatly reduced its DNA-binding activity, suggesting that phosphorylation of HIV-TF1 was essential for DNA binding.
('HIV-TF1', 'Binding', 'HIV-TF1')

LMP-1 induces the expression of bcl2, an oncogene which protects cells from apoptosis, as well as of genes encoding other proteins involved in cell regulation and growth control.
('LMP-1', 'Gene_expression', 'bcl2')

The Tax protein of HTLV-I, a positive transcriptional activator of HTLV-I gene expression, is a viral oncogene that also increases transcription of cellular genes including GM-CSF, IL-2R alpha and IL-2.
('Tax', 'Transcription', 'IL-2'),('Tax', 'Transcription', 'GM-CSF'),('Tax', 'Transcription', 'IL-2R alpha')

Most importantly, we show a Tax-dependent correlation between expression of NFKB2(p100) and processing to the DNA binding NFKB2(p52) form, induction of c-Rel, and trans-activation of NF-kappa B-mediated gene expression.
('NFKB2', 'Localization', 'NFKB2')

We propose that NFKB2 synthesis and processing allows continuous nuclear expression of an otherwise cytoplasmic protein and, in conjunction with overexpression of c-Rel, NFKB2 alters the NF-kappa B signalling pathway and contributes to leukemic transformation of T cells by HTLV-I.
('NFKB2', 'Localization', 'NFKB2')

It represses Runx1 and has a positive role in the induction of Eomes, granzyme B, perforin, and IFN-gamma.
('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin')

Additional experiments are needed to determine whether Eomes and Runx1 are also direct target genes of Runx3.
('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'Eomes')

Surprisingly, Runx3 contributed to the optimal expression of TNF, IL-2, and IFN-gamma at day 4 (Fig.
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'TNF')

For TNF and IL-2, the requirement for Runx3 subsides by day 6 (Fig.
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'TNF')

Runx3 continues to be required for IFN-gamma expression even at day 6, perhaps because of its role in the induction of Eomes expression (Fig.
('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'Eomes'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'IFN-gamma')

T-bet is needed early to confer on activated CD8+ T cells the competence to produce IFN-gamma upon restimulation, but its function is less important at later times.
('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma')

Eomes, which is induced late and functions downstream of Runx3, may substitute for T-bet in promoting the acute expression of IFN-gamma in restimulated CTLs (8).
('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'Eomes'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'IFN-gamma'),('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma')

Indeed, T-bet and Eomes both contribute to perforin expression in NK cells (8, 26), and Eomes induces granzyme B as effectively as T-bet in developing Th2 cells (7); thus, the relative roles of these T-box transcription factors vary depending on cell type.
('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'granzyme B')

Surprisingly, however, Eomes and T-bet appeared nonredundant in their ability to induce two other markers of CTL function, Prf1 and Gzmb (Fig.
('Eomes', 'Positive_regulation', 'Prf1'),('T-bet', 'Positive_regulation', 'Gzmb')

Rather, T-bet and Eomes were involved in regulating granzyme B and perforin expression, respectively: up-regulation of T-bet and Eomes mRNA and protein closely preceded up-regulation of Gzmb and Prf1 mRNA and protein, respectively.
('Eomes', 'Positive_regulation', 'Prf1'),('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'granzyme B'),('T-bet', 'Positive_regulation', 'Gzmb')

T-bet had no role in perforin expression under our culture conditions, and Eo-VP16 did not affect granzyme B expression when expressed in T-bet-/- or Runx3-/- cells.
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'granzyme B'),('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'granzyme B'),('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'perforin'),('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'granzyme B'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Eo-VP16', 'Gene_expression', 'granzyme B')

Because conventional Eomes-deficient mice die before precursor cells can be isolated for bone marrow transfers (27) and because T cells conditionally deficient in Eomes have only recently been described (9), we were unable to introduce Runx3 into Eomes-deficient CD8+ T cells to test formally whether Eomes cooperated with Runx3 to induce perforin expression.
('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'Eomes'),('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin')

Collectively, our data are consistent with a transcriptional network in which preexisting Runx3 cooperates with the induced T-box factors T-bet and Eomes and IL-2Rbeta signals (unpublished data) to orchestrate CTL differentiation (Fig.
('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'Eomes'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2')

Our data recall the "feed-forward" interaction between T-bet and Runx3 that we previously described in CD4+ (Th1) T cells (15) but are distinct in two respects: in differentiating Th1 cells, T-bet is induced by TCR signals and IFN-gamma, and in turn induces Runx3 (15), whereas in differentiating CD8+ T cells, preexisting Runx3 is required to induce the T-box transcription factor Eomes.

Identification of an I kappa B alpha-associated protein kinase in a human monocytic cell line and determination of its phosphorylation sites on I kappa B alpha.
('I kappa B alpha', 'Protein_catabolism', 'I kappa B alpha')

Mutational analyses of I kappa B alpha and competition experiments with the synthetic peptides identified major phosphorylation sites by the bound kinase as Ser and Thr residues in the C-terminal acidic domain of I kappa B alpha.
('I kappa B alpha', 'Protein_catabolism', 'I kappa B alpha')

Moreover, we show that the peptide, corresponding to the C-terminal acidic domain of I kappa B alpha, blocked the LPS-induced NF-kappa B activation as well as inducible phosphorylation of endogenous I kappa B alpha in a cell-free system using THP-1 cells.
('I kappa B alpha', 'Protein_catabolism', 'I kappa B alpha')

These results suggested that the bound kinase is involved in the signaling pathway of LPS by inducing the phosphorylation of the C-terminal region of I kappa B alpha and subsequent dissociation of the NF-kappa B.I kappa B alpha complex.
('I kappa B alpha', 'Protein_catabolism', 'I kappa B alpha')

Triggering of the human interleukin-6 gene by interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in monocytic cells involves cooperation between interferon regulatory factor-1, NF kappa B, and Sp1 transcription factors.
('interferon regulatory factor-1', 'Positive_regulation', 'interleukin-6'),('Sp1', 'Positive_regulation', 'interleukin-6')

Synergistic induction of the IL-6 gene by IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha, in monocytic cells, involved cooperation between the IRF-1 and NF kappa B p65 homodimers with concomitant removal of the negative effect of the retinoblastoma control element present in the IL-6 promoter.
('IRF-1', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-6'),('p65', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-6')

This removal occurred by activation of the constitutive Sp1 factor, whose increased binding activity and phosphorylation were mediated by IFN-gamma.
('IFN-gamma', 'Phosphorylation', 'Sp1')

When the HTLV-1 tax gene was expressed or phorbol myristake acetate-A23187 stimulation was used, ICSAT expression was induced in Jurkat cells which otherwise do not express ICSAT.
('tax', 'Gene_expression', 'ICSAT')

In addition, it has been established that tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) can activate the expression of wild type p53 in concert with the nuclear transcription factor, NF-kappa B.
('TNF-alpha', 'Gene_expression', 'p53')

In this paper we shall advance the hypothesis that: (i) TNF-alpha indirectly controls immune surveillance; and (ii) TNF-alpha controls DNA repair and tumor suppression through the regulation of wild type p53.
('TNF-alpha', 'Gene_expression', 'p53')

The B cell-specific nuclear factor OTF-2 positively regulates transcription of the human class II transplantation gene, DRA.
('OTF-2', 'Transcription', 'DRA')

The promoter of the major histocompatibility class II gene DRA contains an octamer element (ATTTGCAT) that is required for efficient DRA expression in B cells.
('DRA', 'Gene_expression', 'DRA')

This report directly demonstrates that OTF-2 but not OTF-1 regulates the DRA gene.
('OTF-2', 'Transcription', 'DRA'),('OTF-1', 'Transcription', 'DRA')

In vitro transcription analysis using protein fractions enriched for the octamer-binding protein OTF-2 demonstrate a positive functional role for OTF-2 in DRA gene transcription.
('OTF-2', 'Transcription', 'DRA')

In contrast, OTF-1-enriched protein fractions did not affect DRA gene transcription although it functionally enhanced the transcription of another gene.
('OTF-1', 'Transcription', 'DRA')

Recombinant OTF-2 protein produced by in vitro transcription/translation could also enhance DRA gene transcription in vitro.
('OTF-2', 'Transcription', 'DRA')

In vivo transient transfection studies utilizing an OTF-2 expression vector resulted in similar findings: that OTF-2 protein enhanced DRA gene transcription, and that this effect requires an intact octamer element.
('OTF-2', 'Transcription', 'DRA')

Both iNO production and endothelial VCAM-1 expression were induced simultaneously with bacterial LPS and murine-specific IFN-gamma.
('IFN-gamma', 'Gene_expression', 'VCAM-1')

Inhibition of iNO synthase (iNOS) activity with N omega-monomethyl-L-arginine in endothelial-RAW264.7 cocultures, stimulated with murine-specific IFN-gamma and LPS, decreased iNO production by 86%, augmented VCAM-1 and iNOS expression in endothelial and RAW264.7 cells, respectively, and increased monocyte adhesion to the endothelial cell surface.

NleH1 inhibits RPS3 S209 phosphorylation in vivo
('NleH1', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3')

6d), we hypothesized that NleH1 blocked RPS3 S209 phosphorylation in vivo, thereby preventing RPS3 nuclear translocation in infected piglets.
('NleH1', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3')

Consistent with in vitro data, piglets infected with wild-type E. coli O157:H7 exhibited diffuse and low intensity phospho-RPS3 staining, whereas in piglets infected with deltanleH1 mutant, phospho-RPS3 expression was florid and intense (Fig.
('deltanleH1', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3')

These data demonstrate that NleH1 inhibits RPS3 S209 phosphorylation both in vitro and in vivo, which might benefit the bacterium in colonization and transmission.
('NleH1', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3')

Firstly, corticosteroid-activated GR appears to compete with activated GATA-3 for nuclear import via importin-alpha, which is required for the nuclear transport of both GATA-3 and GR.
('GATA-3', 'Binding', 'GATA-3'),('GR', 'Binding', 'GATA-3'),('GATA-3', 'Localization', 'GATA-3'),('GR', 'Localization', 'GATA-3')

We have previously shown that translocation of GATA-3 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus involves the nuclear transporter protein importin-alpha, which interacts with phosphorylated GATA-3 [12].
('GATA-3', 'Binding', 'GATA-3'),('GATA-3', 'Localization', 'GATA-3')

We have also previously reported that GATA-3 knockdown using siRNA results in suppression of anti-CD3/CD28-stimulated IL-4/IL-5 mRNA induction, thus implicating an essential role for GATA-3 in the transcription of these genes [12].
('GATA-3', 'Binding', 'GATA-3'),('GATA-3', 'Localization', 'GATA-3'),('GATA-3', 'Transcription', 'IL-5'),('GATA-3', 'Transcription', 'IL-4')

We now confirm, in human T cells, that GR also uses the same nuclear import mechanism as GATA-3 [22].
('GR', 'Binding', 'GATA-3'),('GR', 'Localization', 'GATA-3')

We therefore propose that there is competition between ligand-activated GR and phospho-GATA-3 for nuclear import.
('GR', 'Binding', 'GATA-3'),('GR', 'Localization', 'GATA-3')

Furthermore, we have shown that there is preferential binding of importin-alpha to activated GR over phospho-GATA-3, so that corticosteroids would preferentially reduce GATA-3 entry and thus rapidly switch off Th2 gene transcription without any need for any intermediate steps.
('GATA-3', 'Binding', 'GATA-3'),('GR', 'Binding', 'GATA-3'),('GATA-3', 'Localization', 'GATA-3'),('GR', 'Localization', 'GATA-3')

We tested some alternative explanations for this effect of FP on GATA-3 nuclear exclusion and failed to show that FP either enhances GATA-3 nuclear export directly or induces GATA-3 degradation.
('GATA-3', 'Binding', 'GATA-3'),('GATA-3', 'Localization', 'GATA-3')

The evidence from the in vitro competition assays does, however, suggest that purified activated GR can clearly attenuate purified phospho-GATA-3-importin-alpha association and that the converse does not occur.
('GR', 'Binding', 'GATA-3'),('GR', 'Localization', 'GATA-3')

We hypothesize that this rapid induction of MKP-1 can reduce GATA-3 nuclear import by attenuating p38 MAPK activity and subsequent GATA-3 phosphorylation, thus preventing nuclear translocation.
('GATA-3', 'Binding', 'GATA-3'),('GATA-3', 'Localization', 'GATA-3')

In summary, our data provide evidence for a novel action of corticosteroids: suppression of allergic inflammation through a rapid inhibitory effect on GATA-3 nuclear translocation by preferential binding to the shared nuclear import protein importin-alpha and by a second mechanism involving increased synthesis of MKP-1, which inhibits p38 MAPK, thus preventing the phosphorylation of GATA-3 that is necessary for nuclear translocation of GATA-3.
('GATA-3', 'Binding', 'GATA-3'),('GATA-3', 'Localization', 'GATA-3')

We demonstrate that upon stimulation by lipopolysaccharide, Taxol, phorbol myristate acetate, interleukin-1, or double-stranded RNA, I kappaB alpha is not degraded, as a result of an absence of induced phosphorylation on serines 32 and 36.

Wild-Type and LMP1 Transgenic Lymphoma Cells Do Not Require IL4 and Stat6 Signaling
('IL4', 'Phosphorylation', 'Stat6')

Activated Stat6 (pStat6), a target of the IL4 receptor pathway, was detected in the wild-type and LMP1 transgenic lymphocytes (Figure 4B).
('IL4', 'Phosphorylation', 'Stat6')

However, the pathway was not disabled, as treatment of the lymphoma cells with IL4 induced Stat6 phosphorylation (Figure 4C).
('IL4', 'Phosphorylation', 'Stat6')

In summary, the wild-type and LMP1 transgenic lymphoma cells grew independently of IL4 treatment and did not require Stat6 signaling.
('IL4', 'Phosphorylation', 'Stat6')

TCF-1 alpha, originally identified and purified through its binding sites on the HIV-1 promoter, was found to bind to the TCR alpha enhancer and to promoters for several genes expressed at significantly earlier stages of T-cell development than the TCR alpha gene (e.g., p56lck and CD3 delta).
('TCR alpha', 'Transcription', 'TCF-1 alpha')

A small 95-bp fragment of the TCR alpha control region that contains the TCF-1 alpha binding site juxtaposed between a cAMP-response element (the CRE or T alpha 1 motif) and the binding site for a distinct lymphoid-specific protein (TCF-2 alpha) behaved as a potent T-cell-specific enhancer in vivo.
('TCR alpha', 'Transcription', 'TCF-1 alpha'),('TCF-2 alpha', 'Transcription', 'TCF-1 alpha')

The TCF-1 alpha binding site was also required for TCR alpha enhancer activity in transcriptionally active extracts from Jurkat but not HeLa cells, confirming that TCF-1 alpha is a T-cell-specific transcription factor.
('TCR alpha', 'Transcription', 'TCF-1 alpha')

Curiously, the TCF-1 alpha binding element was inactive in vivo when removed from its neighboring elements on the TCR alpha enhancer and positioned in one or more copies upstream of a heterologous promoter.
('TCR alpha', 'Transcription', 'TCF-1 alpha')

Thus, the transcriptional activity of TCF-1 alpha appears to depend on the TCF-2 alpha and T alpha 1 (CREB) transcription factors and the context of its binding site within the TCR alpha enhancer.
('CREB', 'Transcription', 'TCF-1 alpha'),('TCR alpha', 'Transcription', 'TCF-1 alpha'),('TCF-2 alpha', 'Transcription', 'TCF-1 alpha')

We examined the contribution of the two isoforms of STAT5, STAT5A and STAT5B, to IL-2- and IL-7-induced activation of human peripheral blood T lymphoblasts.
('IL-7', 'Binding', 'STAT5B'),('IL-2', 'Binding', 'STAT5B'),('IL-7', 'Binding', 'STAT5A'),('IL-2', 'Phosphorylation', 'STAT5A'),('IL-7', 'Phosphorylation', 'STAT5B'),('IL-2', 'Localization', 'STAT5B'),('IL-2', 'Phosphorylation', 'STAT5B'),('IL-2', 'Binding', 'STAT5A'),('IL-2', 'Localization', 'STAT5A'),('IL-7', 'Phosphorylation', 'STAT5A')

Both cytokines induced assembly of STAT5A and STAT5B containing complexes capable of binding to the interferon-gamma activation sequence (GAS), and these complexes rapidly translocated (within 1 min) into the nucleus of IL-2- or IL-7-treated cells.
('IL-7', 'Binding', 'STAT5B'),('IL-2', 'Binding', 'STAT5B'),('IL-7', 'Binding', 'STAT5A'),('IL-2', 'Phosphorylation', 'STAT5A'),('IL-7', 'Phosphorylation', 'STAT5B'),('IL-2', 'Localization', 'STAT5B'),('IL-2', 'Phosphorylation', 'STAT5B'),('IL-2', 'Binding', 'STAT5A'),('IL-2', 'Localization', 'STAT5A'),('IL-7', 'Phosphorylation', 'STAT5A')

IL-2 and IL-7 were equivalent in their ability to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5A and STAT5B and to facilitate binding of these STATs to an immobilized GAS element.
('IL-7', 'Binding', 'STAT5B'),('IL-2', 'Binding', 'STAT5B'),('IL-7', 'Binding', 'STAT5A'),('IL-2', 'Phosphorylation', 'STAT5A'),('IL-7', 'Phosphorylation', 'STAT5B'),('IL-2', 'Localization', 'STAT5B'),('IL-2', 'Phosphorylation', 'STAT5B'),('IL-2', 'Binding', 'STAT5A'),('IL-2', 'Localization', 'STAT5A'),('IL-7', 'Phosphorylation', 'STAT5A')

Both IL-2 and IL-7 induced substantial amounts of STAT5A/STAT5B heterodimerization.

Characterization of this cDNA clone revealed that its induction was dependent on LPS activation of THP-1 cells; hence, the name LPS-induced TNF-alpha factor (LITAF).
('LITAF', 'Positive_regulation', 'TNF-alpha'),('LITAF', 'Gene_expression', 'TNF-alpha')

Inhibition of LITAF mRNA expression in THP-1 cells resulted in a reduction of TNF-alpha transcripts.
('LITAF', 'Positive_regulation', 'TNF-alpha'),('LITAF', 'Gene_expression', 'TNF-alpha')

Together, these findings suggest that LITAF plays an important role in the activation of the human TNF-alpha gene and proposes a new mechanism to control TNF-alpha gene expression.
('LITAF', 'Positive_regulation', 'TNF-alpha'),('LITAF', 'Gene_expression', 'TNF-alpha')

In a concentration-dependent manner, NO inhibited interleukin (IL)-1 alpha-stimulated VCAM-1 expression by 35-55% as determined by cell surface enzyme immunoassays and flow cytometry.

We therefore asked whether IL-4 is able to inhibit TGF-beta induction of FOXP3 during the priming of naive T cells.
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

Human CD4+CD45RA+ T cells were activated with plate-bound anti-CD3/CD28 in the presence of TGF-beta and/or IL-4 and harvested after 5 d. IL-4 efficiently repressed the TGF-beta-mediated induction of FOXP3 expression (Figure 5A) in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 5B).
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

Low levels of GATA3 were induced also in the absence of IL-4, as it was previously observed [3].
('IL-4', 'Negative_regulation', 'GATA3'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'GATA3')

However, at low concentration, IL-4 was able to marginally induce FOXP3 expression.
('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

Of note, GATA3 was also induced in the presence of TGF-beta at high IL-4 concentration (Figure 5A and 5B).
('IL-4', 'Negative_regulation', 'GATA3'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'GATA3')

The IL-4-mediated prevention of FOXP3 expression was not caused by interferences of the receptor signaling, because the phosphorylation of SMAD2 or STAT6 was not affected by the addition of IL-4 and/or TGF-beta, which demonstrates that IL-4 as well as TGF-beta signaling were functional under these conditions (Figure 5C).
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Phosphorylation', 'STAT6'),('IL-4', 'Phosphorylation', 'SMAD2'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Phosphorylation', 'STAT6'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Phosphorylation', 'SMAD2')

Increasing amounts of IL-4 increase intracellular GATA3, whereas FOXP3 decreased, which is consistent with the mRNA analysis (Figure 5D).
('IL-4', 'Negative_regulation', 'GATA3'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'GATA3'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

To study the effects of IL-4 on already-existing human natural or inducible Treg cells, we exposed sorted CD25+ T cells (nTreg cells) to IL-4 and analyzed FOXP3 expression and suppressive capacity.

In already-existing Treg cells, IL-4 failed to inhibit FOXP3 expression (Figure S3A), and the suppressive capacity was not altered (Figure S3C).
('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

Similarly pre-existing iTreg cells did not decrease FOXP3 expression upon IL-4 exposure (Figure S3B).

LMP1 transgenic mice have a higher incidence of lymphoma [26] and the progression to lymphoma correlates with higher expression levels of LMP1 (Figure 1A and 1B), suggesting that LMP1 is directly involved in tumor development.
('LMP1', 'Gene_expression', 'LMP1')

Although many of the molecular properties studied were similar between wild-type and LMP1 transgenic lymphomas, there were distinguishing biological properties, namely the ability of LMP1 transgenic lymphomas to induce higher levels of survival and proliferation.
('LMP1', 'Gene_expression', 'LMP1')

Interestingly, although LMP1 transgenic mice develop lymphomas in the same B-1a cell type as spontaneous wild-type lymphomas (Figure 2), some signaling effects induced by LMP1 may explain the enhanced promotion to lymphomagenesis.
('LMP1', 'Gene_expression', 'LMP1')

In contrast, the preponderance of tumors of B-1a origin does not reflect effects of LMP1 signaling on B cell differentiation, as splenic B cells from healthy LMP1 transgenic mice contain similar numbers of B-1 and B-2 cells as wild-type mice.
('LMP1', 'Gene_expression', 'LMP1')

The lymphomas were marked by the upregulation of IL10, constitutive activation of Stat3 signaling, and a requirement for activation of Akt, NFkappaB, and Stat3 pathways (Figures 5 and 7).
('IL10', 'Positive_regulation', 'Stat3')

In addition, LMP1 has been shown to stimulate IL10 expression in Burkitt lymphoma cell lines [61,62].
('LMP1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL10')

This suggests that although Stat3 is constitutively activated in the lymphoma cells, the induction of IL10 may further enhance Stat3 activation or may contribute to other IL10-responsive signaling pathways.
('IL10', 'Positive_regulation', 'Stat3')

LMP1 activates both the canonical and non-canonical pathways of NFkappaB signaling [14,63-65], and inhibition of NFkappaB blocked the survival of LMP1 transgenic lymphocytes and LMP1-positive and -negative lymphoma cells.
('LMP1', 'Gene_expression', 'LMP1')

We have previously shown that cRel is specifically activated in both wild-type and LMP1 transgenic lymphomas, suggesting that activation of cRel is associated with B cell transformation [27].
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'cRel')

Our observations suggest that similar to CD40-induced proliferation, LMP1 induces proliferation through PI3K-mediated activation of Akt and activation of NFkappaB components such as cRel.
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'Akt'),('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'cRel')

CD40 also induces downregulation of the cell cycle inhibitor p27 through a PI3K-dependent manner, and the LMP1 lymphoma cells also had decreased levels of p27 with phosphorylation of Rb and increased Cdk2 (Figure 6C) [66].
('CD40', 'Negative_regulation', 'p27')

However, the activated pAkt did not lead to phosphorylation and inactivation of the downstream target GSK3 (Figure 6A).
('pAkt', 'Negative_regulation', 'GSK3'),('pAkt', 'Phosphorylation', 'GSK3')

In contrast, rapamycin, U0126, and SB202190 did not affect the survival of LMP1 transgenic lymphocytes or the wild-type and LMP1 transgenic lymphoma cells (Figure 7A, 7C, and 7E).
('LMP1', 'Gene_expression', 'LMP1')

Repression of the pro-apoptotic transcription factor FoxO1 in a PI3K-dependent manner can inhibit expression of bcl6, a transcription factor necessary for GC formation [49,70].
('FoxO1', 'Gene_expression', 'bcl6')

The constitutive signaling by LMP1 likely blocks GC formation through downregulation of bcl6.
('bcl6', 'Gene_expression', 'LMP1'),('LMP1', 'Gene_expression', 'bcl6')

Interestingly, clinical studies indicate that expression of LMP1 and bcl6 are mutually exclusive in non-HD and classical HD [72,73].
('bcl6', 'Gene_expression', 'LMP1'),('LMP1', 'Gene_expression', 'bcl6')

Although the activation of Akt and the lack of Fox01 in the lymphoma cells suggest that LMP1 affects bcl6 and GC formation through this pathway, regulation of other Forkhead targets involved in cell cycle progression, such as p27 and CyclinD2, likely contribute to malignant transformation.
('Akt', 'Negative_regulation', 'Fox01'),('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'Akt'),('bcl6', 'Gene_expression', 'LMP1'),('LMP1', 'Gene_expression', 'bcl6'),('Fox01', 'Regulation', 'bcl6')

Importantly, Akt, NFkappaB, and Stat3 pathways were critically required for the growth and survival of malignant lymphocytes as well as healthy LMP1 transgenic lymphocytes.
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'Akt')

The latter has evolved a mechanism to counteract A3G activity by expressing the regulatory protein Vif (4).
('Vif', 'Negative_regulation', 'A3G'),('Vif', 'Protein_catabolism', 'A3G')

Vif induces proteasomal degradation of A3G and additionally inhibits A3G activity by further mechanisms (8, 37-43).
('Vif', 'Negative_regulation', 'A3G'),('Vif', 'Protein_catabolism', 'A3G')

To investigate whether the overexpression of HIV-1 proteins also influences A3G promoter activity, we either expressed HIV-1 Vif or the HIV-1 Tat protein, the latter has been shown to activate different viral and cellular promoters (44,45).
('Vif', 'Negative_regulation', 'A3G'),('Vif', 'Protein_catabolism', 'A3G')

Luciferase assays showed that the transcriptional activity of the A3G promoter was not significantly altered in the presence of Vif, Tat or HIV-1NL4-3 (Figure 4A), suggesting that HIV-1 is not modulating A3G expression on the transcriptional level.
('Vif', 'Negative_regulation', 'A3G'),('Vif', 'Protein_catabolism', 'A3G')

Interleukin-10 inhibits expression of both interferon alpha- and interferon gamma- induced genes by suppressing tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1.
('Interleukin-10', 'Phosphorylation', 'STAT1')

Therefore, IL-10 can directly inhibit STAT-dependent early response gene expression induced by both IFNalpha and IFNgamma in monocytes by suppressing the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1.
('IL-10', 'Phosphorylation', 'STAT1')

This may occur through the ability of IL-10 to induce expression of the gene, suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3).
('IL-10', 'Gene_expression', 'SOCS3')

Regulation of the Ets-related transcription factor Elf-1 by binding to the retinoblastoma protein.
('retinoblastoma protein', 'Regulation', 'Elf-1')

In this report, it is demonstrated that Elf-1 contains a sequence motif that is highly related to the Rb binding sites of several viral oncoproteins and binds to the pocket region of Rb both in vitro and in vivo.
('Rb', 'Localization', 'Elf-1')

Elf-1 binds exclusively to the underphosphorylated form of Rb and fails to bind to Rb mutants derived from patients with retinoblastoma.
('Rb', 'Localization', 'Elf-1')

Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated an association between Elf-1 and Rb in resting normal human T cells.
('Rb', 'Localization', 'Elf-1')

After T cell activation, the phosphorylation of Rb results in the release of Elf-1, which is correlated temporally with the activation of Elf-1-mediated transcription.
('Rb', 'Localization', 'Elf-1')

Overexpression of a phosphorylation-defective form of Rb inhibited Elf-1-dependent transcription during T cell activation.
('Rb', 'Localization', 'Elf-1')

We report here that 1,25(OH)2D3-mediated repression in Jurkat cells is cycloheximide resistant, suggesting that it is a direct transcriptional repressive effect on IL-2 expression by the vitamin D3 receptor (VDR).
('VDR', 'Transcription', 'IL-2'),('VDR', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2'),('VDR', 'Negative_regulation', 'IL-2')

We therefore examined vitamin D3-mediated repression of activated IL-2 expression by cotransfecting Jurkat cells with IL-2 promoter/reporter constructs and a VDR overexpression vector and by DNA binding.
('VDR', 'Transcription', 'IL-2'),('VDR', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2'),('IL-2', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2'),('VDR', 'Negative_regulation', 'IL-2')

VDR DNA-binding mutants were unable to either bind to this element in vitro or repress in vivo; the VDR DNA-binding domain alone, however, bound the element but also could not repress IL-2 expression.
('VDR', 'Transcription', 'IL-2'),('VDR', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2'),('VDR', 'Negative_regulation', 'IL-2')

These results indicate that DNA binding by VDR is necessary but not sufficient to mediate IL-2 repression.
('VDR', 'Transcription', 'IL-2'),('VDR', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2'),('VDR', 'Negative_regulation', 'IL-2')

By combining partially purified proteins in vitro, we observed the loss of the bound NFATp/AP-1-DNA complex upon inclusion of VDR or VDR-retinoid X receptor.
('VDR', 'Binding', 'NFATp')

Order of addition and off-rate experiments indicate that the VDR-retinoid X receptor heterodimer blocks NFATp/AP-1 complex formation and then stably associates with the NF-AT-1 element.
('VDR', 'Binding', 'NFATp')

We show here that the HIV-1 protease can process p105 and increases levels of active nuclear NF-kappa B complex.

Silencing of human fetal globin expression is impaired in the absence of the adult beta-globin gene activator protein EKLF.
('EKLF', 'Binding', 'beta-globin'),('EKLF', 'Gene_expression', 'beta-globin'),('EKLF', 'Positive_regulation', 'beta-globin')

Previously we and others showed by targeted gene disruption that the zinc finger gene, erythroid Kruppel-like factor (EKLF), is required for expression of the beta-globin gene in mice, presumably through interaction with a high-affinity binding site in the proximal promoter.
('EKLF', 'Binding', 'beta-globin'),('EKLF', 'Gene_expression', 'beta-globin'),('EKLF', 'Positive_regulation', 'beta-globin')

To examine the role of EKLF in the developmental regulation of the human gamma-globin gene we interbred EKLF heterozygotes (+/-) with mice harboring a human beta-globin yeast artificial chromosome transgene.
('EKLF', 'Binding', 'beta-globin'),('EKLF', 'Gene_expression', 'beta-globin'),('EKLF', 'Positive_regulation', 'beta-globin'),('EKLF', 'Regulation', 'gamma-globin'),('EKLF', 'Negative_regulation', 'gamma-globin')

We find that in the absence of EKLF, while human beta-globin expression is dramatically reduced, gamma-globin transcripts are elevated approximately 5-fold.
('EKLF', 'Binding', 'beta-globin'),('EKLF', 'Gene_expression', 'beta-globin'),('EKLF', 'Positive_regulation', 'beta-globin'),('EKLF', 'Regulation', 'gamma-globin'),('EKLF', 'Negative_regulation', 'gamma-globin')

Impaired silencing of gamma-globin expression identifies EKLF as the first transcription factor participating quantitatively in the gamma-globin to beta-globin switch.
('EKLF', 'Binding', 'beta-globin'),('EKLF', 'Gene_expression', 'beta-globin'),('EKLF', 'Positive_regulation', 'beta-globin'),('EKLF', 'Regulation', 'gamma-globin'),('EKLF', 'Negative_regulation', 'gamma-globin')

Our findings are compatible with a competitive model of switching in which EKLF mediates an adult stage-specific interaction between the beta-globin gene promoter and the locus control region that excludes the gamma-globin gene.
('EKLF', 'Binding', 'beta-globin'),('EKLF', 'Gene_expression', 'beta-globin'),('EKLF', 'Positive_regulation', 'beta-globin'),('EKLF', 'Regulation', 'gamma-globin'),('EKLF', 'Negative_regulation', 'gamma-globin')

Functional inactivation of Foxp3 by genetic mutations affecting the Foxp3 coding region, as demonstrated in IPEX, or repression of Foxp3 expression by the HTLV-I-encoded transactivator protein Tax, as recently reported in patients with HAM/TSP, results in loss of regulatory activity in CD4+CD25hi T cells [4,8,17].
('Foxp3', 'Localization', 'Foxp3'),('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'Foxp3'),('Foxp3', 'Negative_regulation', 'Foxp3'),('Tax', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3')

Although it is clear that Foxp3 regulates T cell proliferation and cytokine production, very little is known concerning the molecular mechanisms of Foxp3 function.
('Foxp3', 'Localization', 'Foxp3'),('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'Foxp3'),('Foxp3', 'Negative_regulation', 'Foxp3')

The first evidence to indicate how Foxp3 promotes the development and function of regulatory T cells came from a report by Ziegler and colleagues [16], which suggested that Foxp3 could inhibit transcriptional activation by physically interacting with forkhead binding sites located immediately adjacent to critical cis-acting NF-AT binding sites found in various cytokine promoters (e.g., IL-2 promoter).
('Foxp3', 'Localization', 'Foxp3'),('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'Foxp3'),('Foxp3', 'Negative_regulation', 'Foxp3'),('Foxp3', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-2')

A recent study by Bettelli and colleagues [15] further demonstrated that Foxp3 could inhibit NF-AT as well as NF-kappaB activation, although the mechanism of suppression was shown to involve direct protein-protein interactions between NF-AT or NF-kappaB and Foxp3 rather than binding of Foxp3 to promoter elements adjacent to cis-acting NF-AT or NF-kappaB sites.
('Foxp3', 'Localization', 'Foxp3'),('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'Foxp3'),('Foxp3', 'Negative_regulation', 'Foxp3')

In the present study, we expanded upon these observations by defining additional requirements of Foxp3-mediated repression of NF-kappaB activation, and investigated whether Foxp3 could target additional signaling pathways by examining transcriptional activation of NF-kappaB-dependent and NF-kappaB-independent retroviral pathogens.
('Foxp3', 'Localization', 'Foxp3'),('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'Foxp3'),('Foxp3', 'Negative_regulation', 'Foxp3')

The characterization of the molecular targets of Foxp3 and the mechanism(s) utilized by Foxp3 to support Treg development and function will aid in our understanding of the role Tregs play in the pathogenesis of human autoimmune disease.

Structure and function analysis of the human myeloid cell nuclear differentiation antigen promoter: evidence for the role of Sp1 and not of c-Myb or PU.1 in myelomonocytic lineage-specific expression.
('Sp1', 'Gene_expression', 'myeloid cell nuclear differentiation antigen'),('PU.1', 'Gene_expression', 'myeloid cell nuclear differentiation antigen'),('c-Myb', 'Gene_expression', 'myeloid cell nuclear differentiation antigen')

A region that may also be important with respect to Foxp3 function is the leucine zipper domain, as demonstrated by the number of mutations associated with IPEX that have been mapped in this region of Foxp3.
('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'Foxp3')

Because the pathogenesis of a number of retroviral-induced immunologic disorders such as HIV-1/AIDS and HTLV-I/HAM/TSP have been associated with dysregulation of Foxp3 expression [8,45], we also examined the role of Foxp3 in retroviral gene expression.
('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'Foxp3')

In addition, the FKH domain of Foxp3 was required for this inhibitory effect in HEK 293T cells, but not in Jurkat T cells, similar to Foxp3-mediated suppression of a synthetic NF-kappaB reporter.
('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'Foxp3')

Foxp3 also affected two well-known functions of HTLV-I Tax: transactivation of the NF-kappaB pathway and, most surprisingly, transactivation of the HTLV-I LTR.
('Tax', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3')

Transactivation of the HTLV-I LTR by Tax involves the interaction of ATF/CREB factors with Tax in the nucleus.
('Tax', 'Binding', 'Tax')

Binding of Tax enhances ATF/CREB dimerization and promotes assembly of Tax-ATF/CREB complexes onto specific sequences in the viral promoter known as Tax-responsive elements.
('Tax', 'Binding', 'Tax')

Transactivation of the NF-kappaB pathway by Tax was inhibited by overexpression of full-length Foxp3, but not deltaFKH, as seen with basal activation of the HIV-1 LTR and a synthetic NF-kappaB reporter in HEK 293T cells.
('Tax', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3')

However, Tax-mediated transactivation of the HTLV-I LTR was inhibited by overexpression of both full-length Foxp3 as well as deltaFKH in both HEK 293T cells and CD4+ T cells.
('Tax', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3')

We demonstrated that Foxp3 did not directly affect the functioning of Tax, but rather Foxp3 targeted the transcription factors required for Tax transactivation (i.e., NF-kappaB and a then-unknown cellular factor, which we identified in this study as CREB).
('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'Foxp3'),('Tax', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3'),('Tax', 'Binding', 'Tax')

Importantly, we demonstrated that HTLV-I-infected individuals with the highest levels of Foxp3 protein expression within the CD4+CD25+ T cells population exhibited lower proviral loads than did individuals with the lowest levels of Foxp3 protein expression.
('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'Foxp3')

Therefore, Foxp3 becomes an attractive target for the development of novel therapeutic applications directed at modulating the expression of this important regulatory protein, especially in light of recent observations that the expression of Foxp3 can also be down-regulated by HTLV-I Tax [8].
('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'Foxp3'),('Tax', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3')

As the activation of the HTLV-I LTR depends primarily on ATF/CREB proteins (whether in the presence or the absence of Tax), we investigated whether Foxp3 could interact with this additional cellular signaling pathway.
('Tax', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3')

Our data demonstrate that Foxp3 interferes with the latter of these two processes and that the recruitment of the coactivator protein p300, and resulting transcriptional activation are blocked by Foxp3.
('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'p300'),('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'Foxp3')

This may be the result of the physical interaction we detected between Foxp3 and p300.
('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'p300')

With respect to HTLV-I LTR activity, while full-length Foxp3 inhibited both basal and Tax-dependent transcription by ~50%, deltaFKH appeared less effective in suppressing basal activation (~25% inhibition) compared to Tax-dependent activation (~50% inhibition).
('Tax', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3'),('Tax', 'Binding', 'Tax')

Future studies will be directed at identifying and characterizing cellular proteins that interact with Foxp3 both in the nucleus and cytoplasm, in order to better address how Foxp3 functions to guide the development and function of regulatory T cells in health and disease.
('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'Foxp3')

Similar to IL-4, IL-13 mRNA expression was highest in T-cell populations enriched for cells that had previously been primed in vivo or in vitro, indicating that priming increases the expression of the IL-13 and IL-4 genes in a coordinate manner.
('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-4')

Interleukin-4 (IL-4) plays a major role in this process by promoting the differentiation of IL-4-secreting Th2 cells.
('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-4')

Nuclear factor of activated T cell (NFAT) family members play a critical role in regulating IL-4 transcription and interact with up to five sequences (termed P0 through P4) in the IL-4 promoter.
('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-4')

The molecular mechanisms by which IL-4 induces expression of the IL-4 gene are not known, although the IL-4-activated transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (Stat6) is required for this effect.
('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-4'),('Stat6', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-4')

We report here that Stat6 interacts with three binding sites in the human IL-4 promoter by electrophoretic mobility shift assays.
('Stat6', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-4')

To investigate the role of Stat6 in regulating IL-4 transcription, we used Stat6-deficient Jurkat T cells with different intact IL-4 promoter constructs in cotransfection assays.
('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-4'),('Stat6', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-4')

We show that, whereas a multimerized response element from the germline IgE promoter was highly induced by IL-4 in Stat6-expressing Jurkat cells, the intact human IL-4 promoter was repressed under similar conditions.
('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-4'),('Stat6', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-4')

We conclude that the function of Stat6 is highly dependent on promoter context and that this factor promotes IL-4 gene expression in an indirect manner.
('Stat6', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-4')

Of the GATA-binding proteins, only GATA-4 selectively regulates the human IL-5 gene promoter in IL-5 producing cells which express multiple GATA-binding proteins.
('IL-5', 'Transcription', 'IL-5'),('GATA-4', 'Regulation', 'IL-5')

Using ATL-16T cells which express IL-5 mRNA, we have identified a region, within the human IL-5 gene promoter, that regulates IL-5 gene transcription.
('IL-5', 'Transcription', 'IL-5')

In this report, we describe the cloning of human GATA-4 (hGATA-4) and show that hGATA-4 selectively interacts with the -70 GATA site within the IL-5 proximal promoter region.
('hGATA-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-5'),('GATA-4', 'Regulation', 'IL-5')

Cotransfection experiments revealed that both hGATA-4 and PMA/A23187 stimulation are necessary for the IL-5 promoter activation.
('hGATA-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-5'),('GATA-4', 'Regulation', 'IL-5')

These results demonstrate the selective role of GATA-4 in the transcriptional regulation of the IL-5 gene in a circumstance where multiple members of the GATA-binding proteins are expressed.
('GATA-4', 'Regulation', 'IL-5')

Here we report an analysis of the transcription factor families AP-1, Sp1, NF-kappaB, and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) in cancer patients' lymphocytes before and after IL-2 immunotherapy, as assessed by a gel-shift assay.
('IL-2', 'Binding', 'Sp1')

Over a 3-week course of IL-2 therapy, in most patients the binding patterns of AP-1 , Sp1, and NF-kappaB proteins changed to resemble those seen in PBMC activated by IL-2 in vitro.
('IL-2', 'Binding', 'Sp1')

Although Foxp3 could down-regulate Tax-dependent transactivation of the HTLV-I LTR (Figure 4B) and inhibit Tax expression from an infectious molecular clone (Figure 5), Foxp3 failed to modulate Tax function in the absence of the viral promoter (Figure 4D).
('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

Therefore, we hypothesized that Foxp3 may inhibit Tax transactivation of the HTLV-I LTR via disruption of the CREB signaling pathway.
('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

To test this possibility, HEK 293T cells were transfected with an HTLV-I LTR or synthetic CREB reporter vector along with a control expression vector (EGFP) or expression vectors encoding Foxp3 or DeltaFKH.
('DeltaFKH', 'Positive_regulation', 'CREB')

Like NF-kappaB activation, CREB transcriptional activation was also suppressed by expression of Foxp3, and to a similar extent DeltaFKH, in healthy donor CD4+ T cells (Figure 6B).
('DeltaFKH', 'Positive_regulation', 'CREB')

As observed with NF-kappaB activation, DeltaFKH was a more potent inhibitor of CREB activation in CD4+ T cells than in HEK 293T cells, further indicating that a cell type-specific mechanism of action may govern the function of this Foxp3 mutant.
('DeltaFKH', 'Positive_regulation', 'CREB')

However, Foxp3 failed to markedly affect transcriptional activation of Gal4-BD-c-Jun (c-Jun has also been demonstrated to bind to the HTLV-I LTR) and Gal4-BD-Tax (see Figure 5).
('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

Therefore, our data suggest that Foxp3 may interfere with CREB signaling at an upstream event, such as phosphorylation of CREB or recruitment/function of coactivator proteins CREB-binding protein (CBP)/p300.
('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'p300'),('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'CREB-binding protein')

Co-expression of p65 (Rel A) with the FasL promoter enhanced its activity, and co-expression of IkappaB dramatically inhibited the inducible promoter activity.

The binding of interleukin-2 (IL-2) to its receptor on normal T cells induces nuclear expression of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB), activation of the IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) alpha chain gene, and cell proliferation.
('IL-2', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) alpha chain')

Flow cytometry revealed that primary leukemia cells from a patient with CD8+ T-PLL expressed IL-2Ralpha and beta chains, and the cells showed a proliferative response and an increase in IL-2Ralpha expression on culture with exogeneous IL-2.
('IL-2', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2Ralpha')

Electrophoretic mobility-shift assays revealed that recombinant IL-2 increased NF-kappaB binding activity in nuclear extracts of the leukemia cells, and Northern blot analysis showed that IL-2 increased the abundance of mRNAs encoding the NF-kappaB components c-Rel and KBF1 in these cells.

The present study investigated PPARalpha expression in human ECs and their regulation of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1).
('PPARalpha', 'Gene_expression', 'VCAM-1')

Pretreatment of cultured human ECs with the PPARalpha activators fenofibrate or WY14643 inhibited TNF-alpha-induced VCAM-1 in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, an effect not seen with PPARgamma activators.
('PPARalpha', 'Gene_expression', 'VCAM-1')

Both PPARalpha activators decreased cytokine-induced VCAM-1 mRNA expression without altering its mRNA half-life.
('PPARalpha', 'Gene_expression', 'VCAM-1')

CONCLUSIONS: Human ECs express PPARalpha, a potentially important regulator of atherogenesis through its transcriptional control of VCAM-1 gene expression.
('PPARalpha', 'Gene_expression', 'VCAM-1')

Secretion of IL-2 and TNF-alpha, surface expression of IL-2R, and DNA-binding activity of NF-kappa B and AP-1 (Fos/Jun) complex in response to phorbol myristate acetate, TNF-alpha, or immobilized antibodies to CD3 were monitored.

In 6 of 14 patients, T lymphocytes displayed an impaired ability to translocate NFeB p65 (Rel-A) following activation by anti-CD3 and IL-2.
('Rel-A', 'Transcription', 'IL-2')

Finally, despite impaired Rel-A translocation, T cells were capable of transcribing IL-2.
('Rel-A', 'Transcription', 'IL-2')

Impairments in the translocation of Rel-B and c-Rel further suggest that the NFKB family members Rel-A, Rel-B and c-Rel are not required for the transcription of IL-2 in the peripheral T lymphocytes of patients with breast cancer.
('c-Rel', 'Transcription', 'IL-2'),('Rel-A', 'Transcription', 'IL-2'),('Rel-B', 'Transcription', 'IL-2')

HTLV-I Tax expression leads to the constitutive nuclear expression of biologically active NF-kappa B and c-Rel complexes; however, the biochemical mechanism(s) underlying this response remains poorly understood.
('Tax', 'Gene_expression', 'c-Rel')

We further demonstrate that Tax induction of nuclear c-Rel expression is activated by the RelA (p65) subunit of NF-kappa B, which activates transcription of the c-rel gene through an intrinsic kappa B enhancer element.

IL-10 Production by Th1 Cells Is Dependent on STAT4 but Not on STAT6, IFN-gamma, or IL-4 Signaling
('STAT6', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('STAT4', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('STAT6', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-4'),('IFN-gamma', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('STAT4', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-4'),('STAT4', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IFN-gamma', 'Localization', 'IL-4')

To further elucidate the mechanisms required for the development of Th1 cells producing IL-10, we investigated the role of STAT4, one of the signaling pathways activated by IL-12 (Murphy etal., 2000).
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('STAT4', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Again, IL-10-producing Th1 cells were differentiated at the high antigen dose in the presence of IL-12 in DO11.10 Tcells (Figure2A).
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

In contrast, in the absence of STAT4, the percentage of cells expressing IFN-gamma was dramatically diminished as expected and resulted in an increase in the percentage of cells expressing IL-4, but not IL-10 (Figure2A), suggesting that STAT4 contributes to IL-10 expression by Th1 cells.

Because IL-10 expression is associated with an IL-4-induced Th2 cell phenotype, we investigated whether the differentiation of the IL-10-producing Th1 cells depended on signaling through the IL-4 receptor via STAT6 activation (Glimcher and Murphy, 2000; Murphy etal., 2000).

The absence of STAT6 did not impair the differentiation of IL-10-producing Th1 cells in the presence of IL-12 and OVA (Figure2A).
('STAT6', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('OVA', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

In fact, a higher percentage of STAT6-deficient cells compared with WT cells produced both IL-10 and IFN-gamma (Figure2A), which may be the result of the loss of Th2 cell control over a Th1 cell response.
('STAT6', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IFN-gamma', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

As expected, lack of STAT6 abrogated both IL-4 and IL-10 production by Tcells developed with IL-4 or with low antigen dose (Figures 2B and 2C).
('STAT6', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('STAT6', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-4')

However, in the absence of STAT4 signaling, IL-10 and IL-4 production by Th2 cells was if anything increased (Figures 2B and 2C).
('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('STAT4', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-4'),('STAT4', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Thus, in contrast to what was observed under Th1 conditions, IL-10 expression by Th2 cells depended on STAT6, but not on STAT4, signaling (Figures 2B and 2C).
('STAT6', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('STAT4', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

To investigate whether the inability of STAT4-deficient Tcells to produce IL-10 might be due to the absence of IFN-gamma, as suggested before (Shaw etal., 2006), we differentiated DO11.10 or DO11.10 IFN-gamma-deficient naive CD4+ Tcells in the presence of IL-12 and increasing doses of OVA.
('OVA', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IFN-gamma', 'Regulation', 'IL-12'),('STAT4', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('IFN-gamma', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('STAT4', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

The secretion of IL-10 as induced by high antigen dose, and IL-12 was not affected by an absence of IFN-gamma (Figure2D), showing that the expression ofIL-10 by Th1 cells is independent of IFN-gamma.
('IFN-gamma', 'Regulation', 'IL-12'),('IFN-gamma', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

In the absence of IFN-gamma, we observed an increase in the secreted IL-4 as expected (data not shown).
('IFN-gamma', 'Localization', 'IL-4')

We also tested for any potential role of IL-4 in the development of Th1 cells producing IL-10 by culturing DO11.10 or DO11.10 IL-4-deficient naive CD4+ Tcells with IL-12 and increasing doses of antigen.
('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

As observed in the absence of STAT6 (Figure2A), IL-4 deficiency had no effect on the development of Th1 cells producing IL-10 (Figure2E), but compromised the development of Th2 cells producing IL-10 (Figure2F).
('STAT6', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('STAT6', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-4')

Thus, our data suggested that IL-10 production by Th1 or Th2 cells was dependent on the specific signaling pathways required for their differentiation, given that STAT4 is required for the induction of IL-10 production by Th1 cells and STAT6 for Th2 cells.
('STAT6', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('STAT4', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

The NF-kappaB family includes RelA/p65, c-Rel, RelB, p50 and p52 that share a highly conserved 300-amino acid Rel homology domain (RHD) for homo- or hetero-dimerization and DNA-binding.
('p52', 'Binding', 'c-Rel'),('p52', 'Binding', 'p50'),('RelA', 'Binding', 'p52'),('RelB', 'Binding', 'p52'),('RelA', 'Binding', 'RelB'),('RelB', 'Binding', 'c-Rel'),('p52', 'Binding', 'RelB'),('RelB', 'Binding', 'p50'),('c-Rel', 'Binding', 'RelA'),('c-Rel', 'Binding', 'p52'),('p52', 'Binding', 'RelA'),('c-Rel', 'Binding', 'RelB'),('c-Rel', 'Binding', 'p50'),('p50', 'Binding', 'RelA'),('p50', 'Binding', 'p52'),('p50', 'Binding', 'RelB'),('RelA', 'Binding', 'c-Rel'),('RelB', 'Binding', 'RelA'),('p50', 'Binding', 'c-Rel'),('RelA', 'Binding', 'p50')

The transcriptional activity of the NF-kappaB complex depends on dimer composition since C-terminal unrelated transcriptional activation domains are present exclusively in p65, RelB and c-Rel (2).
('RelB', 'Binding', 'c-Rel'),('c-Rel', 'Binding', 'RelB')

The NF-kappaB activity is enhanced by phosphorylation of p65 at Ser276 by PKA and MSK1 (7,8), Ser311 by PKCzeta (9) and Ser536 by IKKalpha (10,11).
('PKCzeta', 'Phosphorylation', 'p65'),('MSK1', 'Phosphorylation', 'p65'),('IKKalpha', 'Phosphorylation', 'p65')

Acetylation of p65 at Lys218 and Lys221 increases the DNA binding and impairs the association with IkappaB-alpha, and acetylation at Lys310 enhances the p65 transcriptional activity (12,13).
('p65', 'Binding', 'p65')

Deacetylation of p65 by histone deacetylase-3 or SIRT1, or acetylation of p65 at Lys122 and Lys123 down-regulate the NF-kappaB activity (12,21,22).
('p65', 'Binding', 'p65')

In HIV-1 entry, the binding of the gp120 viral envelope to CD4 induces the NF-kappaB activity by activation of IKK (30) and procaspase 8 (31).
('gp120', 'Positive_regulation', 'procaspase 8')

Tat binds to RNA stem-loop structures generated by the 5' end of target transcripts, including the HIV-1 transactivation-responsive element (TAR) (32), tumor necrosis factor beta (TNFbeta) (33) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) (34) to activate gene transcription.
('Tat', 'Transcription', 'interleukin-6'),('Tat', 'Transcription', 'tumor necrosis factor beta')

Following gene transfection or protein transduction, Tat induced the IKK activity and proteasomal degradation of IkappaB-alpha (48), and increased the p65 transcriptional activity by inhibiting the SIRT-1-mediated deacetylation of p65 Lys310 (49).
('p65', 'Binding', 'p65'),('SIRT-1', 'Deacetylation', 'p65'),('Tat', 'Protein_catabolism', 'IkappaB-alpha')

These findings suggested that Tat modulates crucial enzymes involved in NF-kappaB signaling; however, it was unclear how Tat could subvert the negative feedback of NF-kappaB, which is mainly dependent on de novo synthesis of IkappaB-alpha (15,17).
('Tat', 'Protein_catabolism', 'IkappaB-alpha')

We previously found that IkappaB-alpha binds to Tat and promotes the nuclear export of the viral transactivator (50,51).
('Tat', 'Protein_catabolism', 'IkappaB-alpha')

In this study, we report that Tat counteracts the post-activation turn off of NF-kappaB through direct interaction with IkappaB-alpha and p65, which enhances the DNA binding and transcriptional activity of the NF-kappaB complex.
('Tat', 'Protein_catabolism', 'IkappaB-alpha')

The human TF promoter contains binding sites for the transcription factors AP-1, c-Rel/p65, Egr-1, and Sp1.
('Sp1', 'Gene_expression', 'TF'),('p65', 'Gene_expression', 'TF'),('c-Rel', 'Gene_expression', 'TF'),('Egr-1', 'Gene_expression', 'TF')

These data indicated that c-Fos/c-Jun, c-Rel/p65, and Sp1 regulate TF gene expression in human monocytic cells.
('Sp1', 'Gene_expression', 'TF'),('p65', 'Gene_expression', 'TF'),('c-Fos', 'Gene_expression', 'TF'),('c-Rel', 'Gene_expression', 'TF'),('c-Jun', 'Gene_expression', 'TF')

Since both AP-1 and NF-kappa B have been reported to be important in the induction of the tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) gene we examined the effects of okadaic acid on TNF-alpha mRNA levels.
('TNF-alpha', 'Localization', 'TNF-alpha')

Treatment with okadaic acid resulted in a striking increase in TNF-alpha mRNA transcripts within 1 h of stimulation and large amounts of TNF-alpha were released into the culture media.
('TNF-alpha', 'Localization', 'TNF-alpha')

Moreover, cotransfections with c-fos and c-jun expression plasmids markedly enhance induction of the IL-2 promoter in minimally stimulated T cells.

MEK1 and the extracellular signal-regulated kinases are required for the stimulation of IL-2 gene transcription in T cells.
('MEK1', 'Transcription', 'IL-2')

Active Raf-1 phosphorylates and activates the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase 1 (MEK1), which in turn phosphorylates and activates the MAP kinases/extracellular signal regulated kinases, ERK1 and ERK2.
('Raf-1', 'Phosphorylation', 'MEK1'),('MEK1', 'Phosphorylation', 'ERK1'),('MEK1', 'Phosphorylation', 'ERK2')

Raf-1 activity promotes IL-2 production in activated T lymphocytes.
('Raf-1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2')

Therefore, we sought to determine whether MEK1 and ERK activities also stimulate IL-2 gene transcription.
('MEK1', 'Transcription', 'IL-2')

Expression of constitutively active Raf-1 or MEK1 in Jurkat T cells enhanced the stimulation of IL-2 promoter-driven transcription stimulated by a calcium ionophore and PMA, and together with a calcium ionophore the expression of each protein was sufficient to stimulate NF-AT activity.
('MEK1', 'Transcription', 'IL-2'),('Raf-1', 'Phosphorylation', 'MEK1'),('Raf-1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2')

Expression of MEK1-interfering mutants inhibited the stimulation of IL-2 promoter-driven transcription and blocked the ability of constitutively active Ras and Raf-1 to costimulate NF-AT activity with a calcium ionophore.
('MEK1', 'Transcription', 'IL-2'),('Raf-1', 'Phosphorylation', 'MEK1'),('Raf-1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2')

Expression of the MAP kinase-specific phosphatase, MKP-1, which blocks ERK activation, inhibited IL-2 promoter and NF-AT-driven transcription stimulated by a calcium ionophore and PMA, and in addition, MKP-1 neutralized the transcriptional enhancement caused by active Raf-1 and MEK1 expression.
('MEK1', 'Transcription', 'IL-2'),('Raf-1', 'Phosphorylation', 'MEK1'),('Raf-1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2')

We conclude that the MAP kinase signal transduction pathway consisting of Raf-1, MEK1, and ERK1 and ERK2 functions in the stimulation IL-2 gene transcription in activated T lymphocytes.
('MEK1', 'Transcription', 'IL-2'),('Raf-1', 'Phosphorylation', 'MEK1'),('MEK1', 'Phosphorylation', 'ERK1'),('MEK1', 'Phosphorylation', 'ERK2'),('Raf-1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2')

GATA-3 plays a critical role in regulating the expression of the cytokines interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, and IL-13 from T helper-2 (Th2) cells and therefore is a key mediator of allergic diseases.

Overexpression of hematopoietic protein-tyrosine phosphatase (HePTP) results in suppression of T lymphocyte activation as measured by T cell antigen receptor-induced activation of transcription factors binding to the 5' promoter of the interleukin-2 gene.
('HePTP', 'Positive_regulation', '2')

Efforts to pinpoint the exact site of action and specificity of HePTP in the signaling cascade revealed that HePTP acts directly on the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases Erk1 and 2 and consequently reduces the magnitude and duration of their catalytic activation in intact T cells.

IL-10 Production by Th1 Cells Is Dependent on STAT4 but Not on STAT6, IFN-gamma, or IL-4 Signaling
('STAT6', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('STAT4', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('STAT6', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-4'),('IFN-gamma', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('STAT4', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-4'),('STAT4', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IFN-gamma', 'Localization', 'IL-4')

To further elucidate the mechanisms required for the development of Th1 cells producing IL-10, we investigated the role of STAT4, one of the signaling pathways activated by IL-12 (Murphy et al., 2000).
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('STAT4', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Again, IL-10-producing Th1 cells were differentiated at the high antigen dose in the presence of IL-12 in DO11.10 T cells (Figure 2A).
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

In contrast, in the absence of STAT4, the percentage of cells expressing IFN-gamma was dramatically diminished as expected and resulted in an increase in the percentage of cells expressing IL-4, but not IL-10 (Figure 2A), suggesting that STAT4 contributes to IL-10 expression by Th1 cells.
('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('STAT4', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('IFN-gamma', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('STAT4', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-4'),('STAT4', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IFN-gamma', 'Localization', 'IL-4')

Because IL-10 expression is associated with an IL-4-induced Th2 cell phenotype, we investigated whether the differentiation of the IL-10-producing Th1 cells depended on signaling through the IL-4 receptor via STAT6 activation (Glimcher and Murphy, 2000; Murphy et al., 2000).
('STAT6', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('STAT6', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-4')

The absence of STAT6 did not impair the differentiation of IL-10-producing Th1 cells in the presence of IL-12 and OVA (Figure 2A).
('STAT6', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('OVA', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

In fact, a higher percentage of STAT6-deficient cells compared with WT cells produced both IL-10 and IFN-gamma (Figure 2A), which may be the result of the loss of Th2 cell control over a Th1 cell response.
('STAT6', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IFN-gamma', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

As expected, lack of STAT6 abrogated both IL-4 and IL-10 production by T cells developed with IL-4 or with low antigen dose (Figures 2B and 2C).
('STAT6', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('STAT6', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-4')

However, in the absence of STAT4 signaling, IL-10 and IL-4 production by Th2 cells was if anything increased (Figures 2B and 2C).
('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('STAT4', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-4'),('STAT4', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

('STAT6', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('STAT4', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

To investigate whether the inability of STAT4-deficient T cells to produce IL-10 might be due to the absence of IFN-gamma, as suggested before (Shaw et al., 2006), we differentiated DO11.10 or DO11.10 IFN-gamma-deficient naive CD4+ T cells in the presence of IL-12 and increasing doses of OVA.

The secretion of IL-10 as induced by high antigen dose, and IL-12 was not affected by an absence of IFN-gamma (Figure 2D), showing that the expression of IL-10 by Th1 cells is independent of IFN-gamma.

Differential effects of protein kinase C inhibitors on fibronectin-induced interleukin-beta gene transcription, protein synthesis and secretion in human monocytic cells.
('fibronectin', 'Localization', 'interleukin-beta'),('fibronectin', 'Transcription', 'interleukin-beta')

Human monocytic cells express interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) when stimulated with the extracellular matrix glycoprotein, fibronectin (FN).
('FN', 'Transcription', 'IL-1beta'),('FN', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-1beta')

Protein kinase C (PKC) activation is considered important for this process; however, the metabolic steps at which PKC acts upon to mediate the FN-induced IL-1beta response remain unclear.
('FN', 'Transcription', 'IL-1beta'),('FN', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-1beta')

We performed an analysis of the mechanisms by which two PKC inhibitors, Calphostin C and Staurosporine, prevent the FN-induced IL-1beta response.
('FN', 'Transcription', 'IL-1beta'),('FN', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-1beta')

Both inhibitors blocked the secretion of IL-1beta protein into the media of peripheral blood mononuclear cells exposed to FN.
('FN', 'Transcription', 'IL-1beta'),('FN', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-1beta')

These studies revealed that Calphostin C inhibited the nuclear translocation of the transcription factor activator protein-1 (AP-1) which is considered necessary for FN induction of IL-1beta gene transcription, and prevented the transcription of the IL-1beta gene.
('FN', 'Transcription', 'IL-1beta'),('FN', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-1beta')

Based on the high specificity of this compound for PKC, we conclude that PKC is necessary for FN-induced IL-1beta protein production.

Tat activates the p65-dependent expression of NF-kappaB-responsive genes, occupies the NF-kappaB enhancers and promotes the p65 recruitment with IkappaB-alpha displacement
('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65'),('p65', 'Binding', 'Tat'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'IkappaB-alpha')

To this end, HeLa cells were transfected with FLAG-Tat, FLAG-Tat C(22,25,27)A or FLAG-Tat R(49-57)A, and 48 h later the expression of a number of NF-kappaB-dependent genes was analysed by real-time PCR.
('Tat', 'Binding', 'Tat')

Tat significantly increased the expression of MIP-1alpha, CSF3, LTA, NFKBIA and TLR2, while the mutants Tat C(22,25,27)A and Tat R(49-57)A were ineffective (Figure 5A-E).
('Tat R(49-57)A', 'Gene_expression', 'NFKBIA'),('Tat', 'Gene_expression', 'LTA'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'Tat'),('Tat', 'Gene_expression', 'CSF3'),('Tat', 'Gene_expression', 'NFKBIA'),('Tat', 'Gene_expression', 'TLR2'),('Tat C(22,25,27)A', 'Gene_expression', 'NFKBIA'),('Tat R(49-57)A', 'Gene_expression', 'CSF3'),('Tat C(22,25,27)A', 'Gene_expression', 'LTA'),('Tat R(49-57)A', 'Gene_expression', 'MIP-1alpha'),('Tat C(22,25,27)A', 'Gene_expression', 'MIP-1alpha'),('Tat C(22,25,27)A', 'Gene_expression', 'TLR2'),('Tat R(49-57)A', 'Gene_expression', 'TLR2'),('Tat R(49-57)A', 'Gene_expression', 'LTA'),('Tat', 'Gene_expression', 'MIP-1alpha'),('Tat C(22,25,27)A', 'Gene_expression', 'CSF3')

The Tat-dependent transactivation of the NF-kappaB-dependent genes was abolished when cells were transfected with siRNA p65, indicating that the Tat transcriptional activation was mediated by p65 (Figure 5A-E).
('Tat', 'Binding', 'Tat'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65'),('p65', 'Binding', 'Tat')

These results were consistent with the requirement of both the cysteine-rich and arginine-rich domains of Tat to enhance the NF-kappaB activity, suggesting that the up-regulation of NF-kappaB-responsive genes by Tat might occur through physical interaction of the viral protein with p65 and IkappaB-alpha.
('Tat', 'Binding', 'Tat'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65'),('p65', 'Binding', 'Tat'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'IkappaB-alpha')

MIP-1alpha, which was the mostly activated gene by Tat, encodes for a chemokine that promotes the recruitment of pro-inflammatory cells (56).
('Tat', 'Gene_expression', 'MIP-1alpha')

Consistently with our findings, MIP-1alpha expression was increased in glial cells and lymph nodes of AIDS patients (57,58); moreover, MIP-1alpha production was induced by HIV-1 infection (59,60) and Tat protein (57,61,62).
('Tat', 'Gene_expression', 'MIP-1alpha')

To validate the predicted NF-kappaB binding sites of the MIP-1alpha promoter, we stimulated HeLa cells with TNF-alpha, a well-known NF-kappaB inducer, and measured the expression levels of MIP-1alpha by real-time PCR, and the p65 occupancy of the NF-kappaB sites by ChIP.
('TNF-alpha', 'Gene_expression', 'MIP-1alpha'),('TNF-alpha', 'Binding', 'p65')

TNF-alpha activated the expression of MIP-1alpha and induced the p65 recruitment to the NF-kappaB1 site of MIP-1alpha without affecting the occupancy of the putative NF-kappaB2 and NF-kappaB3 sites (Supplementary Figure S3B and S3C).
('TNF-alpha', 'Gene_expression', 'MIP-1alpha'),('TNF-alpha', 'Binding', 'p65')

Tat also promoted the recruitment of p65 to the NF-kappaB1 site of MIP-1alpha, while it did not affect the putative NF-kappaB2 and NF-kappaB3 sites (Supplementary Figure S3D).
('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65'),('p65', 'Binding', 'Tat'),('Tat', 'Gene_expression', 'MIP-1alpha')

Altogether these results indicated that the NF-kappaB1 site was the only effective NF-kappaB enhancer of the MIP-1alpha promoter in response to TNF-alpha and Tat.
('TNF-alpha', 'Gene_expression', 'MIP-1alpha'),('Tat', 'Gene_expression', 'MIP-1alpha')

Similarly to MIP-1alpha, Tat increased the recruitment of p65 to the NF-kappaB enhancers of CSF3, LTA, NFKBIA and TLR2, while it was ineffective at the promoters of GAPDH and ACTB (Figure 5H).
('Tat', 'Gene_expression', 'LTA'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65'),('Tat', 'Gene_expression', 'CSF3'),('Tat', 'Gene_expression', 'NFKBIA'),('Tat', 'Gene_expression', 'TLR2'),('p65', 'Binding', 'Tat'),('Tat', 'Gene_expression', 'MIP-1alpha')

By ChIP, Tat bound to the NF-kappaB-responsive promoters, and not to the GAPDH and ACTB promoters, with loss of binding following p65 RNA interference (Figure 5I), suggesting that Tat occupancy occurred via p65 interaction.
('Tat', 'Binding', 'Tat'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65'),('p65', 'Binding', 'Tat')

As additional findings, IkappaB-alpha was chromatin-immunoprecipitated at the NF-kappaB enhancers in absence of Tat, and it was significantly removed in presence of Tat, or following IkappaB-alpha RNA interference (Figure 5J), indicating that Tat displaced IkappaB-alpha from promoters.

Further analysis of general coactivator requirements showed that selective removal of PC4 from the essential USA fraction severely impairs Oct-1 and OCA-B function in a cell-free system reconstituted with partially purified factors.
('PC4', 'Negative_regulation', 'Oct-1'),('PC4', 'Positive_regulation', 'Oct-1'),('PC4', 'Negative_regulation', 'OCA-B')

Full activity can be restored by the combined action of recombinant PC4 and the PC4-depleted USA fraction, thus suggesting a joint requirement for PC4 and another, USA-derived component(s) for optimal function of Oct-1/OCA-B in the reconstituted system.
('PC4', 'Negative_regulation', 'Oct-1'),('PC4', 'Positive_regulation', 'Oct-1'),('PC4', 'Negative_regulation', 'OCA-B')

Consistent with the requirement for PC4 in the reconstituted system, OCA-B was found to interact directly with PC4.
('PC4', 'Negative_regulation', 'OCA-B')

Surprisingly, however, removal of PC4 from the unfractionated nuclear extract has no detrimental effect on OCA-B/Oct-1-dependent transcription.

GATA3 Is a Negative Regulator of FOXP3 Expression
('GATA3', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

FOXP3 expression decreased once GATA3 expression is high; therefore, we hypothesized a potential role for GATA3 in repressing FOXP3.
('GATA3', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

Besides GATA3's well-known positive effect on gene regulation, GATA3's repressive capabilities were previously shown to restrict Th1 commitment by inhibiting STAT4 expression [2,21], and therefore GATA3 prevents differentiation into Th1 cells.
('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'STAT4')

To investigate whether GATA3 can directly inhibit FOXP3 induction, we transduced GATA3 or a truncated GATA3 lacking the DNA-binding domain in human primary CD4+CD45RA+ T cells using a TAT-fused, recombinantly expressed GATA3.
('GATA3', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

TAT-GATA3 reduced FOXP3 expression in a dose-dependent manner, whereas a DNA-binding domain truncated version (TAT-deltaDBD-GATA3) did not affect FOXP3 expression as compared with expression in untransduced cells (Figure 7A).

To investigate the effect of GATA3 on iTreg, CD4+CD62L+CD25- cells were isolated, activated with OVA in the presence or absence of TGF-beta, and Foxp3 expression was analyzed after 4 d. The naive CD4+CD25- cells were Foxp3- (unpublished data).
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3'),('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3')

As described for the human cells, TGF-beta dramatically up-regulated Foxp3 in the DO11.10 littermate control mice.
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3')

In contrast, cells from the CD2-GATA3xDO11.10 mice showed dramatically reduced Foxp3 expression when activated with TGF-beta and OVA (Figure 7B).

One of the isolated genes, that for retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (RALDH2), was regularly expressed in most of the T-ALL cell lines that coexpressed TAL1 and LMO.
('TAL1', 'Transcription', 'RALDH2')

Exogenously transfected TAL1 and LMO, but not either alone, induced RALDH2 expression in a T-ALL cell line, HPB-ALL, not expressing endogeneous TAL1 or LMO.
('TAL1', 'Transcription', 'RALDH2')

In addition, forced expression of GATA3 potentiated the induction of RALDH2 by TAL1 and LMO, and these three factors formed a complex in vivo.
('TAL1', 'Transcription', 'RALDH2')

Furthermore, a TAL1 mutant not binding to DNA also activated the transcription of RALDH2 in the presence of LMO and GATA3.
('TAL1', 'Transcription', 'RALDH2')

Collectively, we have identified the RALDH2 gene as a first example of direct transcriptional target genes regulated by TAL1 and LMO in T-ALL.
('TAL1', 'Transcription', 'RALDH2')

In this case, TAL1 and LMO act as cofactors for GATA3 to activate the transcription of RALDH2.
('TAL1', 'Transcription', 'RALDH2')

Involvement of NF-kappaB p50/p65 heterodimer in activation of the human pro-interleukin-1beta gene at two subregions of the upstream enhancer element.

We show that effector CTL differentiation occurs in two sequential phases in vitro, characterized by early induction of T-bet and late induction of Eomesodermin (Eomes), T-box transcription factors that regulate the early and late phases of interferon (IFN) gamma expression, respectively.
('Eomesodermin', 'Gene_expression', 'interferon (IFN) gamma'),('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'interferon (IFN) gamma')

Runx3 regulates Eomes expression as well as expression of three cardinal markers of the effector CTL program: IFN-gamma, perforin, and granzyme B.

Phosphorylation of TRAF2 inhibits binding to the CD40 cytoplasmic domain.
('TRAF2', 'Binding', 'CD40')

TRAF2 is a signal transducing adaptor molecule which binds to the CD40 cytoplasmic domain.
('TRAF2', 'Binding', 'CD40')

Furthermore, the phosphorylation status of TRAF2 had significant effects on the ability of the protein to bind to CD40, as evidenced by our observations that the CD40 cytoplasmic domain interacted preferentially with underphosphorylated TRAF2 and that phosphatase treatment significantly enhanced the binding of TRAF2 to CD40.
('TRAF2', 'Binding', 'CD40'),('TRAF2', 'Binding', 'TRAF2')

We conclude from these studies that the phosphorylation of TRAF2 is likely to play an important role in regulating signaling by virtue of its ability to influence the CD40-TRAF2 interaction.
('TRAF2', 'Binding', 'CD40'),('TRAF2', 'Binding', 'TRAF2')

Transcriptional activation of the human TF gene in monocytic cells exposed to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is mediated by binding of c-Rel/p65 heterodimers to a kappa B site in the TF promoter.
('c-Rel', 'Positive_regulation', 'TF'),('p65', 'Positive_regulation', 'TF')

These results indicated that salicylates inhibited LPS induction of TF gene transcription in monocytic cells by preventing nuclear translocation of c-Rel/p65 heterodimers.
('c-Rel', 'Positive_regulation', 'TF'),('p65', 'Positive_regulation', 'TF')

Functional association of Nmi with Stat5 and Stat1 in IL-2- and IFNgamma-mediated signaling.
('Nmi', 'Binding', 'Stat1')

Interestingly, Nmi lacks an intrinsic transcriptional activation domain; instead, Nmi enhances the association of CBP/p300 coactivator proteins with Stat1 and Stat5, and together with CBP/p300 can augment IL-2- and IFNgamma-dependent transcription.
('Nmi', 'Binding', 'Stat1')

Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) is activated by a diverse set of receptors that determine T-cell function, including the T-cell antigen receptor (TCR), the costimulatory receptor CD28, and negative regulators of T-cell activation such as CTLA-4.
('CTLA-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'PI 3-kinase')

NleH1 inhibits RPS3 phosphorylation in vitro
('NleH1', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('NleH1', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

The E. coli O157:H7 EDL933 effector protein NleH1 binds to and attenuates RPS3 nuclear translocation, thus impairing RPS3-dependent NF-kappaB signaling9.
('NleH1', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('NleH1', 'Localization', 'RPS3'),('RPS3', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

We therefore hypothesized that NleH1 may function by inhibiting RPS3 S209 phosphorylation.
('NleH1', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('NleH1', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

As expected, transfecting increasing amounts of NleH1-HA plasmid blocked TNFalpha-induced NF-kappaB activation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.
('TNF', 'Gene_expression', 'NleH1')

Remarkably, NleH1 reduced both TNF-induced, as well as basal RPS3 phosphorylation to roughly 20% of vehicle control (Fig.
('TNF', 'Gene_expression', 'NleH1'),('TNF', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('TNF', 'Localization', 'RPS3'),('NleH1', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('NleH1', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

Expressing NleH1 does not interfere with either TNF-induced IKK activation or IkappaBalpha degradation, consistent with the lack of NleH1 impact on p65 nuclear translocation9 (Fig.
('TNF', 'Gene_expression', 'NleH1'),('NleH1', 'Localization', 'p65'),('NleH1', 'Protein_catabolism', 'IkappaBalpha')

To determine if NleH1 inhibits RPS3 phosphorylation, we infected HeLa cells with E. coli O157:H7 strains possessing or lacking either nleH1 (deltanleH1) or with a strain lacking a functional T3SS unable to inject NleH1 into mammalian cells (deltaescN).
('NleH1', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('NleH1', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

In uninfected cells, TNF-treatment stimulated a ~7-fold increase in RPS3 S209 phosphorylation, peaking at 30 minutes (Fig.
('TNF', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('TNF', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

However, TNF-induced RPS3 S209 phosphorylation was unimpaired in cells infected with either deltanleH1 or deltaescN (Fig.
('TNF', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('TNF', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

We showed previously that wild-type, but not deltanleH1 or deltaescN E. coli O157:H7 significantly attenuated TNF-induced RPS3 nuclear translocation9.
('TNF', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('TNF', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

The parallel between RPS3 phosphorylation and its nuclear translocation during E. coli infection provides evidence in the context of an NF-kappaB-dependent disease process that RPS3 S209 phosphorylation is important for nuclear translocation.
('RPS3', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

Our discovery that NleH1 inhibits RPS3 S209 phosphorylation suggested that it should also blocks RPS3-dependent NF-kappaB target gene transcription (e.g.
('NleH1', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('NleH1', 'Localization', 'RPS3'),('RPS3', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

In contrast, deleting nleH1 had no impact on the expression of RPS3-independent genes, including CD25 and TNFSF13B (Supplementary Fig.
('TNF', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('TNF', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

Together these results demonstrate that NleH1 specifically inhibits the protective immune response by directly blocking RPS3 S209 phosphorylation and thereby impairing critical RPS3-dependent NF-kappaB target genes.

Thrombin-induced p65 homodimer binding to downstream NF-kappa B site of the promoter mediates endothelial ICAM-1 expression and neutrophil adhesion.
('Thrombin', 'Binding', 'p65')

We investigated the mechanisms by which proinflammatory mediator, thrombin, released during intravascular coagulation and tissue injury, induces ICAM-1 (CD54) expression in endothelial cells.
('thrombin', 'Gene_expression', 'ICAM-1')

Stimulation of HUVEC with thrombin resulted in dose- and time-dependent increases in ICAM-1 mRNA and cell surface expression and in ICAM-1-dependent endothelial adhesivity toward polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
('thrombin', 'Gene_expression', 'ICAM-1')

Transient transfection of endothelial cells with ICAM-1 promoter luciferase reporter gene (ICAM-1LUC) constructs indicated that deletion of upstream NF-kappa B site (-533 bases from translation start site) had no effect on thrombin responsiveness, whereas mutation/deletion of downstream NF-kappa B site (-223 bases from the translation start site) prevented the activation of ICAM-1 promoter, indicating that the downstream NF-kappa B site is critical for thrombin inducibility.
('thrombin', 'Gene_expression', 'ICAM-1')

Gel supershift assays demonstrated that thrombin induced binding of NF-kappa Bp65 (Rel A) to downstream NF-kappa B site of the ICAM-1 promoter.
('thrombin', 'Binding', 'Rel A'),('thrombin', 'Gene_expression', 'ICAM-1')

Thrombin receptor activation peptide, a 14-amino-acid peptide representing the new NH2 terminus of proteolytically activated receptor-1, mimicked thrombin's action in inducing ICAM-1 expression.
('thrombin', 'Gene_expression', 'ICAM-1')

These data indicate that thrombin activates endothelial ICAM-1 expression and polymorphonuclear leukocyte adhesion by NF-kappa Bp65 binding to the downstream NF-kappa B site of ICAM-1 promoter after proteolytically activated receptor-1 activation.
('proteolytically activated receptor-1', 'Binding', 'p65'),('thrombin', 'Gene_expression', 'ICAM-1')

Examination of IkappaB alpha regulation revealed that TNF-alpha-mediated degradation of IkappaB alpha in both memory and naive T cells from the elderly was severely impaired, thus contributing to the lowered induction of the observed NFkappaB.
('TNF-alpha', 'Protein_catabolism', 'IkappaB alpha')

However, in contrast with TNF-alpha, dopamine treatment did not affect NF-kappaB DNA binding activity nor the concentrations of p50, p65 and IkappaB-alpha proteins, which suggests a distinct NF-kappaB activation mechanism.
('TNF-alpha', 'Regulation', 'IkappaB-alpha'),('TNF-alpha', 'Regulation', 'p65'),('TNF-alpha', 'Regulation', 'p50')

The v-src-induced complex comprised the p50 and p65 components of NF-kappa B, as determined by supershift and immunoblot analysis.
('v-src', 'Binding', 'p50')

Interestingly, the DEX-mediated IkappaBalpha induction was completely inhibited by IL-2, but not IL-4, in Th1 cells, while the reverse profile was seen in Th2 cells.

BMP-6 induces upregulation of Id1
('BMP-6', 'Positive_regulation', 'Id1')

Next, we wanted to explore whether the BMP-6 induced phosphorylation of Smad 1/5/8 also could induce transcriptional changes of target genes.
('BMP-6', 'Phosphorylation', 'Smad 1'),('BMP-6', 'Phosphorylation', '8'),('BMP-6', 'Phosphorylation', '5')

Thus, B cells were pre-incubated over night in X-VIVO 15, and then cultured in medium alone or in the presence of BMP-6 for various time points before preparation of total RNA.
('BMP-6', 'Phosphorylation', '5')

Interestingly, we observed a specific four-fold upregulation of Id1 mRNA in BMP-6-treated B cells (Figure 7).
('BMP-6', 'Positive_regulation', 'Id1')

The up-regulation of Id1 mRNA was characteristic of an early inducible gene, with maximal upregulation two hours after the addition of BMP-6 and returned to baseline after 24 hours.
('BMP-6', 'Positive_regulation', 'Id1')

Western blot analysis revealed that the BMP-6-induced upregulation of Id1 mRNA also was correlated with upregulation of Id1 protein as well.
('Id1', 'Positive_regulation', 'Id1'),('BMP-6', 'Positive_regulation', 'Id1')

The increase in Id1 protein level was detectable after one hour and increased until 24 hours after BMP-6 addition, showing a 16-fold upregulation compared with t0 (p </= 0.020, n = 4) (Figure 8 and 9).
('BMP-6', 'Phosphorylation', '8'),('BMP-6', 'Positive_regulation', 'Id1')

Taken together, these data suggest that Id1 could be a possible target gene for mediating the effects of BMP-6 in human B cells, whereas Id2 and Id3 not seem to be involved.
('BMP-6', 'Positive_regulation', 'Id1'),('BMP-6', 'Gene_expression', 'Id3'),('BMP-6', 'Gene_expression', 'Id2')

After its associated proteins, especially the heat-shock protein hsp90, had been cross-linked with the hMR by dimethylpimelimidate, 18C7 was still able to react with the receptor.

We therefore asked whether IL-4 is able to inhibit TGF-beta induction of FOXP3 during the priming of naive T cells.
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

Human CD4+CD45RA+ T cells were activated with plate-bound anti-CD3/CD28 in the presence of TGF-beta and/or IL-4 and harvested after 5 d. IL-4 efficiently repressed the TGF-beta-mediated induction of FOXP3 expression (Figure 5A) in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 5B).
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

Low levels of GATA3 were induced also in the absence of IL-4, as it was previously observed [3].
('IL-4', 'Negative_regulation', 'GATA3'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'GATA3')

However, at low concentration, IL-4 was able to marginally induce FOXP3 expression.
('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

Of note, GATA3 was also induced in the presence of TGF-beta at high IL-4 concentration (Figure 5A and 5B).
('IL-4', 'Negative_regulation', 'GATA3'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'GATA3')

The IL-4-mediated prevention of FOXP3 expression was not caused by interferences of the receptor signaling, because the phosphorylation of SMAD2 or STAT6 was not affected by the addition of IL-4 and/or TGF-beta, which demonstrates that IL-4 as well as TGF-beta signaling were functional under these conditions (Figure 5C).
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Phosphorylation', 'STAT6'),('IL-4', 'Phosphorylation', 'SMAD2'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Phosphorylation', 'STAT6'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Phosphorylation', 'SMAD2')

Increasing amounts of IL-4 increase intracellular GATA3, whereas FOXP3 decreased, which is consistent with the mRNA analysis (Figure 5D).
('IL-4', 'Negative_regulation', 'GATA3'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'GATA3'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

To study the effects of IL-4 on already-existing human natural or inducible Treg cells, we exposed sorted CD25+ T cells (nTreg cells) to IL-4 and analyzed FOXP3 expression and suppressive capacity.
('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

In already-existing Treg cells, IL-4 failed to inhibit FOXP3 expression (Figure S3A), and the suppressive capacity was not altered (Figure S3C).
('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

Similarly pre-existing iTreg cells did not decrease FOXP3 expression upon IL-4 exposure (Figure S3B).
('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

The gene expression of interferon (IFN)-inducible protein 10 (IP-10) (a CXC chemokine) was markedly augmented by the IFNgamma treatment in PMA- or RA-differentiated U937 cells, but only marginally in undifferentiated or VitD3-treated cells.
('IFNgamma', 'Transcription', 'IP-10'),('IFNgamma', 'Gene_expression', 'IP-10')

In contrast, another inducible gene expression of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (a CC chemokine) and the activation of the transcriptional factor (FcRFgamma) bound to the gamma response region were similarly or less abundantly induced by IFNgamma treatment in PMA- or RA-differentiated U937 cells, indicating that increased IP-10 mRNA induction was not due to the augmented ability of the cells to respond to the presence of IFNgamma.
('IFNgamma', 'Transcription', 'IP-10'),('IFNgamma', 'Gene_expression', 'IP-10'),('IFNgamma', 'Gene_expression', 'monocyte chemotactic protein-1')

Increased expression of IFNgamma-induced IP-10 mRNA following the differentiation of U937 cells was mediated largely by augmented transcriptional activity of the gene and was related to differentiation-dependent changes of the proteins bound to IFN stimulus response element (ISRE) and kB sites, suggesting that these nuclear proteins may determine the IP-10 mRNA inducibility by IFNgamma.

Structure/function analysis of various Oct-2a effector regions in the context of the GAL4 DNA-binding domain revealed that Oct-2a contains two functionally different activation domains at the N and the C termini.
('Oct-2a', 'Positive_regulation', 'Oct-2a')

The possibility that Oct-2a can act as an activator and/or a repressor may have important consequences for the function of Oct-2a in B cell differentiation and other developmental processes.

Glucocorticoids are known to downregulate interleukin-1 beta production in monocytic cells by two different mechanims: direct inhibition of the gene transcription and destabilization of the preformed interleukin-1 beta mRNA.

Cross-linking of CD44 on rheumatoid synovial cells up-regulates VCAM-1.
('CD44', 'Transcription', 'VCAM-1'),('CD44', 'Gene_expression', 'VCAM-1')

Using synovial cells from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, we demonstrated that CD44 cross-linking and binding to hyaluronan augmented VCAM-1 expression and subsequently VCAM-1-mediated cell adhesion.
('CD44', 'Transcription', 'VCAM-1'),('CD44', 'Gene_expression', 'VCAM-1')

Briefly, we found that 1) rheumatoid synovial cells highly expressed CD44; 2) cross-linking of CD44 markedly but transiently augmented VCAM-1 expression and its mRNA transcription much more than did IL-1beta and TNF-alpha; 3) hyaluronan, especially when fragmented, also up-regulated VCAM-1; 4) CD44 activated the transcription factor AP-1; and 5) the integrin-dependent adhesive function of RA synovial cells to T cells was also amplified by CD44 cross-linking.
('CD44', 'Transcription', 'VCAM-1'),('CD44', 'Transcription', 'IL-1beta'),('CD44', 'Gene_expression', 'VCAM-1'),('CD44', 'Transcription', 'TNF-alpha')

These results indicate that the adhesion of RA synovial cells to matrices such as hyaluronic acid through CD44 could up-regulate VCAM-1 expression and VCAM-1-mediated adhesion to T cells, which might in turn cause activation of T cells and synovial cells in RA synovitis.
('CD44', 'Transcription', 'VCAM-1'),('CD44', 'Gene_expression', 'VCAM-1')

This action of the phosphatase inhibitors, which is associated with the activation of the RelA.p50 NF-kappa B heterodimer, is not affected by agents that block the induction of I kappa B alpha phosphorylation by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha).
('TNF-alpha', 'Phosphorylation', 'I kappa B alpha'),('TNF-alpha', 'Protein_catabolism', 'I kappa B alpha')

Furthermore, the phosphorylated I kappa B alpha from calyculin A-treated cells, but not that from TNF-alpha-stimulated cells, is sensitive to PP-2A in vitro, suggesting the existence of fundamental differences in the phosphorylation of I kappa B alpha induced by the two different NF-kappa B inducers.
('TNF-alpha', 'Phosphorylation', 'I kappa B alpha'),('TNF-alpha', 'Protein_catabolism', 'I kappa B alpha')

However, induction of I kappa B alpha phosphorylation by both TNF-alpha and the phosphatase inhibitors is associated with the subsequent degradation of I kappa B alpha.
('TNF-alpha', 'Phosphorylation', 'I kappa B alpha'),('TNF-alpha', 'Protein_catabolism', 'I kappa B alpha')

We further demonstrate that TNF-alpha- and calyculin A-induced I kappa B alpha degradation exhibits similar but not identical sensitivities to a proteasome inhibitor.
('TNF-alpha', 'Phosphorylation', 'I kappa B alpha'),('TNF-alpha', 'Protein_catabolism', 'I kappa B alpha')

Together, these results suggest that phosphorylation of I kappa B alpha, mediated through both the TNF-alpha-inducible and the PP-2A-opposing kinases, may serve to target I kappa B alpha for proteasome-mediated degradation.
('TNF-alpha', 'Phosphorylation', 'I kappa B alpha'),('TNF-alpha', 'Protein_catabolism', 'I kappa B alpha')

TNF-alpha, therefore, emerges as the main factor responsible for a second phase of NF-kappa B regulation, controlling both translocation of p65 and c-rel, and new mRNA synthesis for c-rel and p105/p50.

LMP1 Activates Akt Signaling and Deregulates the Rb Cell Cycle Pathway
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'Akt')

LMP1 transformation of rodent fibroblasts requires activation of PI3K and Akt [5].
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'Akt')

To determine if Akt signaling is activated in LMP1 transgenic mice, pAkt and several of its targets were assessed by immunoblotting of splenic CD19+ MACS-purified B cells.
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'Akt')

LMP1 transgenic B cells had increased levels of pAkt compared to wild-type lymphocytes; however, progression to lymphoma in both LMP1-positive and -negative lymphoma cells did not further increase pAkt levels.
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'Akt')

This finding indicates that GSK3 is not a target of activated Akt in the LMP1 transgenic lymphocytes and lymphoma cells.
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'Akt')

Activated p-mTOR was not increased in LMP1 transgenic lymphocytes or lymphoma cells, indicating that this pathway is not affected by LMP1-induced Akt activation and does not contribute to lymphoma development (Figure 6B).
('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'Akt')

Immunoblot analysis indicated that total FoxO1 levels were greatly decreased in wild-type and LMP1 transgenic lymphomas (Figure 6B), suggesting that inhibition of the Forkhead signaling pathway is an important target of Akt in lymphoma development.
('Akt', 'Negative_regulation', 'FoxO1'),('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'Akt')

However, considering that Akt activation did not induce FoxO1 degradation in LMP1 transgenic B cells, Akt may not be the sole regulator of FoxO1, and it may be that progression to lymphoma requires modulation of multiple pathways.
('Akt', 'Negative_regulation', 'FoxO1'),('LMP1', 'Positive_regulation', 'Akt')

The integrin alpha 4 beta 1 can provide a costimulus to induce IL-2 secretion and IL-2R expression leading to enhanced proliferation of purified, peripheral blood T cells.
('integrin alpha 4 beta 1', 'Localization', 'IL-2'),('integrin alpha 4 beta 1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2R')

Although TGF-beta-reduced CD25, IL-4 expression, and CD25 expression (Figure 6B), IL-4 significantly inhibited TGF-beta-mediated induction of FOXP3 in naive T cells driven toward FOXP3+ T cells, as shown by FACS analysis (Figure 6A).
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-4'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'CD25'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Negative_regulation', 'CD25')

It is known that IL-4 is a potent growth factor and may therefore favor the proliferation of FOXP3- cells and thus decrease the relative percentage of FOXP3+ cells.
('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

However, analysis of cell division kinetics by CFSE-labeling demonstrated that IL-4 did not differentially promote cell growth of FOXP3+ over that of FOXP3-.
('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

Furthermore the TGF-beta-mediated induction of FOXP3 expression was not caused by overgrowth of a CD25-FOXP3+ minority, since the number of FOXP3+ cells was low/absent in the purified CD4+CD45RA+ T cells (between 0% and 1%), and the FOXP3+ cells were not confined to the highly divided cells.
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'CD25')

CD25 was down-regulated in TGF-beta-treated cells compare to activated T cells, which was even more pronounced in cells cultured with TGF-beta and IL-4.
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-4'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'CD25'),('IL-4', 'Negative_regulation', 'CD25')

The addition of IL-4 to iTreg-driving conditions decreased the number of FOXP3+ cells (Figure 6B).
('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

In line with the previous findings, the IL-4-producing cells and the FOXP3 expressing cells are nonoverlapping populations.
('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

The expression kinetic of naive T cells exposed to IL-4 and TGF-beta demonstrated that GATA3 and FOXP3 are initially found in separate populations (day 2), but transiently co-express both factors (days 4-8), before establishing separate populations at the end of the differentiation process (day 10; Figure 6C), suggesting that GATA3 inhibits the development of iTreg cells by repressing FOXP3.
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-4'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'GATA3'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'GATA3'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

These results showed that IL-4 acts in vitro as an inhibitor of FOXP3 expression, without interfering with TGF-beta signaling, probably acting at the level of transcription factors, and possibly by a GATA3-dependent mechanism.
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-4'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'GATA3'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'GATA3'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

The up-regulation of IL-1beta message could be mediated by the latent membrane protein-1, EBV nuclear proteins 2, 3, 4, and 6 genes.

Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) demonstrated that the -300 region of the IL-1beta promoter, which contains a nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) binding site, contained a functional RBP binding site.
('3', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-1beta')

In addition, the expression of latent membrane protein-1 led to activation of NF-kappaB that was capable of binding the IL-1beta promoter.
('latent membrane protein-1', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-1beta')

Differential regulation of proto-oncogenes c-jun and c-fos in T lymphocytes activated through CD28.
('CD28', 'Gene_expression', 'c-jun'),('CD28', 'Gene_expression', 'c-fos'),('CD28', 'Positive_regulation', 'c-jun')

In addition to activation of phospholipase C gamma 1, ligation of this receptor also seems to activate a calcium-independent, CD28-specific pathway.
('CD28', 'Positive_regulation', 'phospholipase C gamma 1')

In this paper, we report that cross-linking of CD28 (but not CD2, CD5, LFA-1, or CD7) leads to an elevation of c-jun mRNA, with only minimal activation of c-fos expression.
('CD7', 'Positive_regulation', 'c-jun'),('CD28', 'Gene_expression', 'c-jun'),('CD28', 'Gene_expression', 'c-fos'),('CD28', 'Positive_regulation', 'c-jun'),('CD5', 'Positive_regulation', 'c-jun')

CD28-dependent induction of c-jun expression requires protein tyrosine kinase activity, but does not depend on activation of a phorbol ester-responsive protein kinase C or elevation of cytosolic calcium.
('CD28', 'Gene_expression', 'c-jun'),('CD28', 'Positive_regulation', 'c-jun')

Furthermore, CD28-dependent elevation of c-jun mRNA does not appear to be mediated at the level of mRNA stability.
('CD28', 'Gene_expression', 'c-jun'),('CD28', 'Positive_regulation', 'c-jun')

A mechanism is suggested whereby expression of c-jun and junB, in the absence of members of the fos family, can prevent inappropriate activation of T cells caused by ligation of CD28 in the absence of a specific antigenic stimulus.

IL-10 Production Is Maintained by High TCR Signal Strength and IL-12
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10')

We next investigated whether repeated strong TCR activation is a compensatory signal for IL-12-induced STAT4 signaling in the induction of IL-10 in Th1 cells.
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10')

High antigen dose and IL-12 cooperated to induce maximal IL-10 production (Figures 4A and 4B), given that this combination resulted in the highest numbers of IL-10-producing Th1 cells.
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10')

Repeated high antigen dose stimulation in the absence of exogenously added IL-12 resulted in the production of IL-10 by Th1 cells, suggesting that repeated strong TCR triggering may overcome the need for IL-12 for IL-10 induction (Figures 4C and 4D).
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10')

However, IL-10 induction under these conditions was abrogated when IL-12p40-deficient DCs were used as APCs (Figure 4E).
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12p40', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10')

Thus, IL-12 is essential during both primary and secondary antigenic stimulation for production of IL-10 by Th1 cells.
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10')

To determine the requirements for stability of the IL-10-producing Th1 cells, we differentiated CD4+ T cells for 1 week with high antigen doses with or without IL-12 (Figures 4A and 4C), washed them, and then restimulated them for an additional week with a low antigen dose, in the absence or presence of IL-12 (Figure 4F).
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10')

Th1 cells induced in the first week to produce IL-10 by culture with high antigen doses and IL-12 lost their ability to express IL-10 when recultured with low doses of OVA, which could be compensated for, to some extent, by addition of IL-12 to the secondary cultures (Figure 4F), again suggesting that antigen dose and IL-12 signals cooperate for the induction of IL-10.
('OVA', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10')

Finally, DO11.10 CD4+ cells that were exposed to low doses of antigen and IL-12 during the primary differentiation phase produced high amounts of IFN-gamma but little IL-10, but they could be induced to produce IL-10 when both high antigen dose and IL-12 were present during the recall phase (Figure S4).
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10')

Thus, high antigen dose and IL-12 are required for sustaining the induction of IL-10 production by Th1 cells.
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10')

As shown in Figure 7D, expression of KD-PKCalpha in RAW 264.7 cells did not affect the constitutive phosphorylation at Ser536 of NF-kappaB p65, but attenuated the phosphorylation at Ser276.
('PKCalpha', 'Phosphorylation', 'p65')

These observations demonstrate that PKCalpha is important in M-CSF-regulated cell survival and NF-kappaB activation and likely regulated through phosphorylation of Ser276 of NF-kappaB p65.
('PKCalpha', 'Phosphorylation', 'p65')

To further validate the impact that PKCalpha played in M-CSF-induced NF-kappaB transcriptional activity, we next employed PKCalpha siRNA treatment of MDM or RAW cells.
('PKCalpha siRNA', 'Gene_expression', 'PKCalpha')

A pool of specific PKCalpha siRNA were transfected into MDM or Raw 264.7 cells in the presence or absence or M-CSF.
('PKCalpha siRNA', 'Gene_expression', 'PKCalpha')

We also examined cell survival of the MDMs by Annexin V-FITC and PI staining after PKCalpha siRNA transfection.
('PKCalpha siRNA', 'Gene_expression', 'PKCalpha')

As shown in Figure 7G, M-CSF-induced MDM survival was reduced in the cells transfected with PKCalpha siRNA compared with cells transfected with control siRNA (p = 0.047).
('PKCalpha siRNA', 'Gene_expression', 'PKCalpha')

In Figure 7H, we confirmed that PKCalpha siRNA transfection decreased PKCalpha protein expression in both MDM and Raw 264.7 cells.
('PKCalpha siRNA', 'Gene_expression', 'PKCalpha')

In contrast, IFN-gamma priming did not affect the expression of p105 transcripts but enhanced the expression of p65 mRNA (two-fold).
('IFN-gamma', 'Gene_expression', 'p65')

Priming with IFN-gamma followed by LPS stimulation resulted in a further increase in the expression of p65 mRNA.
('IFN-gamma', 'Gene_expression', 'p65')

Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) demonstrated that unstimulated monocytes predominantly expressed p50 NF-kappa B. Stimulation with LPS or IFN-gamma resulted in the expression of p50 and p65 subunits, while the combination of IFN-gamma plus LPS caused a further increase in the expression of NF-kappa B.
('IFN-gamma', 'Gene_expression', 'p65'),('IFN-gamma', 'Gene_expression', 'p50')

With Western blotting, it was shown that nuclear extracts from monocytes contained p50 and p65 protein in response to LPS and IFN-gamma stimulation.
('IFN-gamma', 'Gene_expression', 'p65'),('IFN-gamma', 'Gene_expression', 'p50')

The effects of IFN-gamma on the transcription factors were specific, since no change was observed in the expression of NF-IL-6 or I kappa B alpha, the inhibitor of NF-kappa B.

Role of CBFbeta in the induction of Foxp3
('CBFbeta', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3')

To target all Runx proteins that might be involved in the induction of Foxp3, we used mice in which loxP-flanked Cbfb alleles were inactivated in T cells through expression of a CD4-cre transgene.
('Runx', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3'),('Runx', 'Positive_regulation', 'Foxp3')

Retinoic acid and TGF-beta synergize in the induction of Foxp3 in naive T cells (Kang et al., 2007).
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3')

To investigate whether Runx-mediated induction of Foxp3 is dependent on the expression of CBFbeta, naive CD4+ CD8- T cells from CbfbF/F CD4-cre and control CbfbF/+ CD4-cre mice were stimulated with anti-CD3/28 mAbs, retinoic acid, and increasing concentrations of TGF-beta.
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3'),('Runx', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3'),('CBFbeta', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3'),('Runx', 'Positive_regulation', 'Foxp3')

After 3 d in culture, the cells were restimulated with PMA and ionomycin and analyzed for intracellular Foxp3 and IFN-gamma expression.
('IFN-gamma', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3')

TGF-beta induced Foxp3 in CbfbF/+ CD4-cre cells in a dose dependent manner, and this was significantly reduced in CbfbF/F CD4-cre cells.
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3')

Retinoic acid enhanced Foxp3 expression even in 20 pg/ml of TGF-beta and more than 95% of the CD4+ T cells from CbfbF/+ CD4-cre mice became Foxp3+ in 100 and 500 pg/ml TGF-beta doses.
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3')

The induction of Foxp3 was again significantly lower in CbfbF/F CD4-cre CD4+ T cells even in the presence of retinoic acid, demonstrating that deficiency in Runx binding to DNA affects the TGF-beta induction of Foxp3 in T reg cells (Fig.
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3'),('Runx', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3'),('Runx', 'Positive_regulation', 'Foxp3')

There was no difference in the induction of Foxp3 when endogenous IL-4 and IFN-gamma were neutralized (Fig.
('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3'),('IFN-gamma', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3')

The importance of RUNX transcription factors for the in vivo conversion of naive CD4+ T cells into iT reg cells was examined.
('RUNX', 'Gene_expression', 'CD4')

These data affirm the significance of RUNX proteins for the in vivo generation of CD4+ Foxp3+ T cells.
('RUNX', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3'),('RUNX', 'Gene_expression', 'CD4')

In this investigation an enhanced and prolonged IL-2 and IL-2 mRNA response was also detected in both stimulated (T cell mitogens or alloantigens) murine splenocytes and in the stimulated murine T cell line EL-4 in the presence of ciprofloxacin (5-80 micrograms/ml) as compared to control cells without antibiotics.
('IL-2', 'Transcription', 'IL-2')

Taken together, cipro inhibited IFN-gamma synthesis, but enhanced IL-2 production in murine lymphocytes by means of influencing NFAT-1 and causing an increased IL-2 transcription.
('NFAT-1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2'),('IL-2', 'Transcription', 'IL-2')

Two distinct signalling pathways are involved in the control of the biphasic junB transcription induced by interleukin-6 in the B cell hybridoma 7TD1.
('interleukin-6', 'Transcription', 'junB')

We have measured the level of junB mRNA in the B hybridoma cell line 7TD1, under interleukin-6 (IL-6) stimulation.
('interleukin-6', 'Transcription', 'junB'),('IL-6', 'Transcription', 'junB')

IL-6 increases junB mRNA in a biphasic fashion.
('IL-6', 'Transcription', 'junB')

The first early-induced peak was transient and likely corresponds to the well documented typical junB mRNA, stimulated in response to numerous growth factors, including IL-6.
('IL-6', 'Transcription', 'junB')

As a consequence of its effect on junB mRNA, IL-6 stimulated, in a biphasic fashion, the nuclear accumulation of the JunB protein.
('junB', 'Localization', 'JunB'),('IL-6', 'Transcription', 'junB')

In this study, we demonstrated that IL-6 regulation occurred exclusively at the transcriptional level and that the bimodal increase of junB mRNA and JunB protein can be accounted for by a biphasic stimulation of junB transcription.
('junB', 'Localization', 'JunB'),('IL-6', 'Transcription', 'junB')

Furthermore, our data point to two major differences between the mechanism of control of the early and the late IL-6-induced junB transcription waves.
('IL-6', 'Transcription', 'junB')

Altogether these data indicate that, in 7TD1 cells, IL-6 controls junB transcription in a biphasic fashion by means of two separate transduction pathways.
('IL-6', 'Transcription', 'junB')

We found that overexpression of IkappaB-alpha in endothelial cells using a recombinant adenovirus prevented tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)-induced degradation of IkappaB-alpha and suppressed the upregulation of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and E-selectin mRNA and surface protein expression and the upregulation of transcripts for the chemokines monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) and growth-related activity-alpha (GRO-alpha) by TNF-alpha.
('TNF-alpha', 'Transcription', 'GRO-alpha'),('TNF-alpha', 'Transcription', 'MCP-1'),('TNF-alpha', 'Protein_catabolism', 'IkappaB-alpha')

Adhesion assays under physiological shear flow conditions showed that firm arrest, spreading, and transmigration of monocytes on TNF-alpha-activated endothelium was markedly inhibited by IkappaB-alpha overexpression.

Immunoprecipitation of epitope-labeled BKO demonstrated for the formation of a tight complex with endogenous B subunit in Jurkat cells, consistent with an inhibitory mechanism that involves the sequestration of the B subunit.

Runx3 controls Eomes, perforin, granzyme B, and IFN-gamma expression in effector CTLs.
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'granzyme B'),('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'Eomes'),('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma')

Runx3+/+ or Runx3-/- CD8+ T cells were activated and transduced with retroviruses bearing an empty IRES-GFP cassette (GFP) or also encoding Eomes-VP16 (Eo-VP16) or Myc-Runx3 (Runx3).
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'Eomes')

T-bet is induced by TCR signals and is essential for early IFN-gamma expression.
('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma')

Runx3 is present in naive CD8+ T cells and represses Runx1 and induces Eomes, perforin, granzyme B, and IFN-gamma expression.
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'granzyme B'),('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'Eomes'),('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma')

Eomes may participate in sustaining late IFN-gamma expression, whereas Runx3 and Eomes (but not T-bet) may cooperate to activate perforin expression.
('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'Eomes'),('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma')

The dotted line indicates the partial effect of T-bet deficiency on Gzmb mRNA but not granzyme B protein expression.

In contrast to the decrease in GR mRNA seen in IM-9 cells after treatment with 1 microM dexamethasone for 16-18 h, treatment of 6TG1.1 cells resulted in an 8-fold increase in GR mRNA, as determined by Northern blot and RNase protection analysis, with a corresponding 3- to 4-fold increase in GR protein.
('GR', 'Gene_expression', 'GR')

Half-maximal induction of GR mRNA and protein in 6TG1.1 cells was observed between 10-100 nM dexamethasone, and inclusion of 1 microM RU 38486 completely blocked the effects of 100 nM dexamethasone, demonstrating that positive autoregulation of GR expression in 6TG1.1 cells is a receptor-mediated response.
('GR', 'Gene_expression', 'GR')

Positive autoregulation of GR expression was also observed in glucocorticoid-resistant CEM-C1 cells, which contain functional GR, but whose growth is unaffected by glucocorticoids.
('GR', 'Gene_expression', 'GR')

It represses Runx1 and has a positive role in the induction of Eomes, granzyme B, perforin, and IFN-gamma.
('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin')

Additional experiments are needed to determine whether Eomes and Runx1 are also direct target genes of Runx3.
('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'Eomes')

Surprisingly, Runx3 contributed to the optimal expression of TNF, IL-2, and IFN-gamma at day 4 (Fig.
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'TNF')

For TNF and IL-2, the requirement for Runx3 subsides by day 6 (Fig.
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'TNF')

Runx3 continues to be required for IFN-gamma expression even at day 6, perhaps because of its role in the induction of Eomes expression (Fig.
('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'Eomes'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'IFN-gamma')

T-bet is needed early to confer on activated CD8+ T cells the competence to produce IFN-gamma upon restimulation, but its function is less important at later times.
('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma')

Eomes, which is induced late and functions downstream of Runx3, may substitute for T-bet in promoting the acute expression of IFN-gamma in restimulated CTLs (8).
('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'Eomes'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'IFN-gamma'),('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma')

Indeed, T-bet and Eomes both contribute to perforin expression in NK cells (8, 26), and Eomes induces granzyme B as effectively as T-bet in developing Th2 cells (7); thus, the relative roles of these T-box transcription factors vary depending on cell type.
('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'granzyme B')

Surprisingly, however, Eomes and T-bet appeared nonredundant in their ability to induce two other markers of CTL function, Prf1 and Gzmb (Fig.
('Eomes', 'Positive_regulation', 'Prf1'),('T-bet', 'Positive_regulation', 'Gzmb')

Rather, T-bet and Eomes were involved in regulating granzyme B and perforin expression, respectively: up-regulation of T-bet and Eomes mRNA and protein closely preceded up-regulation of Gzmb and Prf1 mRNA and protein, respectively.
('Eomes', 'Positive_regulation', 'Prf1'),('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'granzyme B'),('T-bet', 'Positive_regulation', 'Gzmb')

T-bet had no role in perforin expression under our culture conditions, and Eo-VP16 did not affect granzyme B expression when expressed in T-bet-/- or Runx3-/- cells.
('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'granzyme B'),('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'granzyme B'),('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'perforin'),('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'granzyme B'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Eo-VP16', 'Gene_expression', 'granzyme B')

Because conventional Eomes-deficient mice die before precursor cells can be isolated for bone marrow transfers (27) and because T cells conditionally deficient in Eomes have only recently been described (9), we were unable to introduce Runx3 into Eomes-deficient CD8+ T cells to test formally whether Eomes cooperated with Runx3 to induce perforin expression.
('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'Eomes'),('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'perforin'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin')

Collectively, our data are consistent with a transcriptional network in which preexisting Runx3 cooperates with the induced T-box factors T-bet and Eomes and IL-2Rbeta signals (unpublished data) to orchestrate CTL differentiation (Fig.
('Runx3', 'Positive_regulation', 'Eomes'),('Runx3', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2')

Our data recall the "feed-forward" interaction between T-bet and Runx3 that we previously described in CD4+ (Th1) T cells (15) but are distinct in two respects: in differentiating Th1 cells, T-bet is induced by TCR signals and IFN-gamma, and in turn induces Runx3 (15), whereas in differentiating CD8+ T cells, preexisting Runx3 is required to induce the T-box transcription factor Eomes.

Cross-linking CD40 on B cells can lead to homotypic cell adhesion, IL-6 production, and, in combination with cytokines, to Ig isotype switching.

Furthermore, Tax-induced transactivation of the bcl-x promoter was also diminished by the mutant IkappaBalpha, which specifically inhibits NF-kappaB activity.

Immunodepletion studies show that PTF beta is required for transcription of both classes of snRNA genes in vitro.

This result suggests that the cAMP response element binding protein, CREB, is involved in the protein-TRE-DNA complex and in mediating the Tax response.
('CREB', 'Regulation', 'Tax')

On the other hand, the up-regulation of CD80 Ag, found on monocytes obtained from PBMC incubated with OKT3, is not detected after addition of IL-10, and the anti-CD28 mAb CLB-CD28/1 restores the NF-kappa B/Rel nuclear activity in IL-10-inhibited lymphocytes.

Jak3 is associated with CD40 and is critical for CD40 induction of gene expression in B cells.
('CD40', 'Phosphorylation', 'Jak3'),('CD40', 'Binding', 'Jak3'),('CD40', 'Positive_regulation', 'Jak3')

We show that engagement of CD40 induces tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of Jak3 as well as of STAT3.
('CD40', 'Phosphorylation', 'Jak3'),('CD40', 'Phosphorylation', 'STAT3'),('CD40', 'Positive_regulation', 'STAT3'),('CD40', 'Binding', 'Jak3'),('CD40', 'Positive_regulation', 'Jak3')

Jak3 is constitutively associated with CD40, and this interaction requires a proline-rich sequence in the membrane-proximal region of CD40.
('CD40', 'Phosphorylation', 'Jak3'),('CD40', 'Binding', 'Jak3'),('CD40', 'Positive_regulation', 'Jak3')

Deletion of this sequence abolishes the capacity of CD40 to induce expression of CD23, ICAM-1, and lymphotoxin-alpha genes in B cells.
('CD40', 'Gene_expression', 'lymphotoxin-alpha'),('CD40', 'Gene_expression', 'CD23'),('CD40', 'Gene_expression', 'ICAM-1')

These results indicate that signaling through Jak3 is activated by CD40 and plays an important role in CD40-mediated functions.

Cell adhesion to endothelial cells stimulated by tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) is due to induction of surface receptors, such as vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1).
('TNF', 'Gene_expression', 'VCAM-1'),('TNF', 'Transcription', 'VCAM-1')

Since kappa B motifs are present in VCAM-1 and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) promoters, we used PDTC to study the regulatory mechanisms of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 induction and subsequent monocyte adhesion in TNF-treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs).
('TNF', 'Gene_expression', 'VCAM-1'),('TNF', 'Transcription', 'ICAM-1'),('TNF', 'Transcription', 'VCAM-1'),('TNF', 'Gene_expression', 'ICAM-1')

PDTC or N-acetylcysteine dose dependently reduced TNF-induced VCAM-1 but not ICAM-1 surface protein (also in human umbilical arterial endothelial cells) and mRNA expression (by 70% at 100 mumol/L PDTC) in HUVECs as assessed by flow cytometry and polymerase chain reaction.
('TNF', 'Gene_expression', 'VCAM-1'),('TNF', 'Transcription', 'ICAM-1'),('TNF', 'Transcription', 'VCAM-1'),('TNF', 'Gene_expression', 'ICAM-1')

Gel-shift analysis in HUVECs demonstrated that PDTC prevented NF-kappa B mobilization by TNF, suggesting that only VCAM-1 induction was controlled by NF-kappa B.
('TNF', 'Gene_expression', 'VCAM-1'),('TNF', 'Transcription', 'VCAM-1')

Since HUVECs released superoxide anions in response to TNF, and H2O2 induces VCAM-1, PDTC may act as a radical scavenger.
('TNF', 'Gene_expression', 'VCAM-1'),('TNF', 'Transcription', 'VCAM-1')

Although ICAM-1 induction was unaffected, inhibitors of NADPH oxidase (apocynin) or cytochrome P-450 (SKF525a) suppressed VCAM-1 induction by TNF, revealing that several radical-generating systems are involved in its regulation.

HOIP is required for CD40-mediated CD80 upregulation and activation of germline epsilon transcription
('CD40', 'Gene_expression', 'CD80'),('HOIP', 'Positive_regulation', 'CD80'),('CD40', 'Positive_regulation', 'CD80')

Engagement of CD40 on B cells upregulates expression of CD80 [10], a cell surface protein that promotes activation of T cells interacting with B cells and other APC.
('CD40', 'Gene_expression', 'CD80'),('CD40', 'Positive_regulation', 'CD80')

To begin evaluating potential contributions of HOIP to CD40 signaling, we assayed the upregulation of CD80 induced by engagement of CD40 on parental A20.2J, HOIP-deficient, and HOIP-reconstituted cells (Fig.
('CD40', 'Gene_expression', 'CD80'),('HOIP', 'Positive_regulation', 'CD80'),('CD40', 'Positive_regulation', 'CD80')

Compared to the parental cell line, the CD40-stimulated upregulation of CD80 was dramatically reduced in all HOIP-deficient cells tested.
('CD40', 'Gene_expression', 'CD80'),('HOIP', 'Positive_regulation', 'CD80'),('CD40', 'Positive_regulation', 'CD80')

In contrast, upregulation of CD80 was restored in HOIP-reconstituted cells, confirming that the defect in CD80 upregulation in the HOIP-deficient cells was due to the disruption of Rnf31.
('HOIP', 'Positive_regulation', 'CD80')

CTLA-4 engagement by mAbs inhibits, while CD28 enhances, IL-2 production and proliferation upon T cell activation.
('CD28', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-2'),('CTLA-4', 'Transcription', 'IL-2')

CTLA-4 ligation inhibited CD3/CD28-induced IL-2 mRNA accumulation by inhibiting IL-2 transcription, which appears to be mediated in part through decreasing NF-AT accumulation in the nuclei.
('CD28', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-2'),('CTLA-4', 'Transcription', 'IL-2')

However, CTLA-4 ligation did not appear to affect the CD28-mediated stabilization of IL-2 mRNA.
('CD28', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-2'),('CTLA-4', 'Transcription', 'IL-2')

Further, CTLA-4 engagement inhibited progression through the cell cycle by inhibiting the production of cyclin D3, cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk)4, and cdk6 when the T cells were stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28 and with anti-CD3 alone.

These results indicate that CTLA-4 signaling inhibits events early in T cell activation both at IL-2 transcription and at the level of IL-2-independent events of the cell cycle, and does not simply oppose CD28-mediated costimulation.

IKKbeta phosphorylation regulates RPS3 nuclear translocation and NF-kappaB function duringEscherichia coliO157:H7 infection
('IKKbeta', 'Localization', 'RPS3'),('IKKbeta', 'Protein_modification', 'RPS3')

Here we report that IKKbeta phosphorylation of serine 209 (S209) was crucial for RPS3 nuclear localization in response to activating stimuli.
('IKKbeta', 'Localization', 'RPS3'),('IKKbeta', 'Protein_modification', 'RPS3')

Moreover, the foodborne pathogen Escherichia coli O157:H7 virulence protein NleH1 specifically inhibited RPS3 S209 phosphorylation and blocked RPS3 function, thereby promoting bacterial colonization and diarrhea but decreasing mortality in a gnotobiotic piglet infection model.
('NleH1', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('RPS3', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

Thus, the IKKbeta-dependent modification of a specific amino acid in RPS3 promotes specific NF-kappaB functions that underlie the molecular pathogenetic mechanisms of E. coli O157:H7.

Tat associates with p65 increasing its DNA-affinity binding.
('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65')

(A) HeLa cells were transfected with pRc/CMV-3xHA-p65 (5 microg) in presence or absence of p3xFLAG-Tat, p3xFLAG-Tat T,N(23,24)A, p3xFLAG-Tat K(50,51)A, p3xFLAG-Tat R(49-57)A, or p3xFLAG-Tat C(22,25,27)A (5 microg).

Transcription-independent turnover of I kappa B alpha during monocyte adherence: implications for a translational component regulating I kappa B alpha/MAD-3 mRNA levels.
('I kappa B alpha', 'Positive_regulation', 'I kappa B alpha')

The demonstration that NF-kappa B can regulate I kappa B alpha/MAD-3 gene transcription in other cell types suggested that the rapid increase in steady-state I kappa B alpha/MAD-3 mRNA levels we observed within 30 min of monocyte adherence would result from NF-kappa B-dependent transcriptional stimulation of the I kappa B alpha/MAD-3 gene.
('I kappa B alpha', 'Positive_regulation', 'I kappa B alpha')

Interestingly, while increases in both IL-1 beta and I kappa B alpha/MAD-3 mRNA levels were detected in nuclei of adherent monocytes, cytoplasmic levels of IL-1 beta mRNA increased during adherence whereas those of I kappa B alpha/MAD-3 mRNA did not.
('I kappa B alpha', 'Positive_regulation', 'I kappa B alpha')

We propose that adherent monocytes regulate nuclear processing (or decay) of I kappa B alpha/MAD-3 mRNA, thereby increasing mRNA levels without stimulating I kappa B alpha/MAD-3 gene transcription.
('I kappa B alpha', 'Positive_regulation', 'I kappa B alpha')

Moreover, since inhibition of protein synthesis leads to accumulation of I kappa B alpha/MAD-3 mRNA without stimulating I kappa B alpha/MAD-3 gene transcription, we suggest that low cytoplasmic levels of I kappa B alpha/MAD-3 mRNA are maintained by a translation-dependent degradation mechanism.
('I kappa B alpha', 'Positive_regulation', 'I kappa B alpha')

Specific inhibitors of p38alpha MAPk blocked LPS-induced adhesion, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) activation, and synthesis of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha).
('p38alpha MAPk', 'Gene_expression', 'TNF-alpha')

Inhibition of p38alpha MAPk resulted in a transient decrease in TNF-alpha mRNA accumulation but persistent loss of TNF-alpha synthesis.
('p38alpha MAPk', 'Gene_expression', 'TNF-alpha')

These findings support a pathway by which LPS stimulation of neutrophils results in activation of MKK3, which in turn activates p38alpha MAPk, ultimately regulating adhesion, NF-kappaB activation, enhanced gene expression of TNF-alpha, and regulation of TNF-alpha synthesis.
('p38alpha MAPk', 'Gene_expression', 'TNF-alpha')

IL-10 Production by Th1 Cells Requires ERK1 and ERK2 Activation
('ERK2', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('ERK1', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10')

Our data showed that the maintenance of IL-10 induction in Th1 cells required stimulation with high antigen dose, which to some extent could be compensated for by the addition of IL-12.
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Although the apparent peak and amount of ERK1 and ERK2 activation varied slightly between experiments, a consistent finding was that high antigen dose differentiated Th1 cells always showed enhanced and prolonged ERK1 and ERK2 activation in the presence of IL-12, regardless of whether they were restimulated with high or low antigen dose (Figure 5B).
('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'ERK1'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'ERK2')

We then investigated whether ERK1 and ERK2 activation was required for the induction of IL-10 in Th1 cells by using U0126 (Figure 5C), a compound that blocks downstream ERK activation.
('ERK2', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('ERK1', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10')

As in the APC-driven cultures, stronger TCR stimulation together with IL-12 led to higher percentages of cells producing both IL-10 and IFN-gamma after 1 week of culture (Figure 5C).
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Because U0126 inhibits the MEK5-catalyzed activation of ERK5, as well as the MEK1- and MEK2-catalyzed activation of ERK1 and ERK2 (Bain et al., 2007; Mody et al., 2001), we also used the more specific, structurally unrelated MEK1 and MEK2 inhibitor PD184352 at concentrations in which it inhibits MEK1 and MEK2 but not MEK5 (Bain et al., 2007; Mody et al., 2001).
('MEK2', 'Positive_regulation', 'ERK1'),('MEK5', 'Positive_regulation', 'ERK5'),('MEK1', 'Positive_regulation', 'ERK2'),('MEK1', 'Positive_regulation', 'ERK1'),('MEK2', 'Positive_regulation', 'ERK2')

Upon addition of inhibitors to other signaling pathways, including a p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB203580, or the GSK3beta inhibitor, CT99021 (Bain et al., 2007), no effect on IL-10 production was observed (Figure S5B).
('p38 MAPK', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('GSK3beta', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Our data thus suggested that IL-10 production by Th1 cells in response to high antigen dose and IL-12 requires ERK1 and ERK2 signaling, but not the activation of the p38 or the GSK3beta pathways.

BMP-6 induces upregulation of Id1
('BMP-6', 'Positive_regulation', 'Id1')

Next, we wanted to explore whether the BMP-6 induced phosphorylation of Smad 1/5/8 also could induce transcriptional changes of target genes.
('BMP-6', 'Phosphorylation', 'Smad 1'),('BMP-6', 'Phosphorylation', '8'),('BMP-6', 'Phosphorylation', '5')

Thus, B cells were pre-incubated over night in X-VIVO 15, and then cultured in medium alone or in the presence of BMP-6 for various time points before preparation of total RNA.
('BMP-6', 'Phosphorylation', '5')

Interestingly, we observed a specific four-fold upregulation of Id1 mRNA in BMP-6-treated B cells (Figure 7).
('BMP-6', 'Positive_regulation', 'Id1')

The up-regulation of Id1 mRNA was characteristic of an early inducible gene, with maximal upregulation two hours after the addition of BMP-6 and returned to baseline after 24 hours.
('BMP-6', 'Positive_regulation', 'Id1')

Western blot analysis revealed that the BMP-6-induced upregulation of Id1 mRNA also was correlated with upregulation of Id1 protein as well.
('Id1', 'Positive_regulation', 'Id1'),('BMP-6', 'Positive_regulation', 'Id1')

The increase in Id1 protein level was detectable after one hour and increased until 24 hours after BMP-6 addition, showing a 16-fold upregulation compared with t0 (p <= 0.020, n = 4) (Figure 8 and 9).
('BMP-6', 'Phosphorylation', '8'),('BMP-6', 'Positive_regulation', 'Id1')

Taken together, these data suggest that Id1 could be a possible target gene for mediating the effects of BMP-6 in human B cells, whereas Id2 and Id3 not seem to be involved.

Tat relieves p65 from the IkappaB-alpha inhibition.
('Tat', 'Negative_regulation', 'p65')

(C) 35S-methionine-labeled p65 (5 microl) was incubated with in vitro translated HA-IkappaB-alpha (5 microl) in presence or absence of FLAG-Tat or FLAG-Tat R(49-57)A (5, 10 or 20 microl).
('HA-IkappaB-alpha', 'Binding', 'p65'),('Tat', 'Negative_regulation', 'p65')

HA-IkappaB-alpha was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody; immunocomplexes were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and analysed by western blotting with anti-HA and anti-FLAG antibodies, or autoradiography (35S-Met-p65).
('HA-IkappaB-alpha', 'Binding', 'p65')

32P-labeled-NF-kappaB double-stranded oligonucleotide was incubated with p65 (0.5 microl) in presence or absence of HA-IkappaB-alpha (1 microl), FLAG-Tat or FLAG-Tat R(49-57)A (5 and 10 microl); competition of DNA binding was performed with 10 - up to 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled NF-kappaB double-stranded oligonucleotide.

Human immunodeficiency virus-1 Tat activates NF-kappaB via physical interaction with IkappaB-alpha and p65
('Tat', 'Binding', 'IkappaB-alpha'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65')

We report that in single round HIV-1 infection, or single-pulse PMA stimulation, the HIV-1 Tat transactivator activated NF-kappaB by hijacking the inhibitor IkappaB-alpha and by preventing the repressor binding to the NF-kappaB complex.
('Tat', 'Binding', 'IkappaB-alpha')

Moreover, Tat associated with the p65 subunit of NF-kappaB and increased the p65 DNA-binding affinity and transcriptional activity.
('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65')

The arginine- and cysteine-rich domains of Tat were required for IkappaB-alpha and p65 association, respectively, and for sustaining the NF-kappaB activity.
('Tat', 'Binding', 'IkappaB-alpha'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65')

Among an array of NF-kappaB-responsive genes, Tat mostly activated the MIP-1alpha expression in a p65-dependent manner, and bound to the MIP-1alpha NF-kappaB enhancer thus promoting the recruitment of p65 with displacement of IkappaB-alpha; similar findings were obtained for the NF-kappaB-responsive genes CSF3, LTA, NFKBIA and TLR2.
('Tat', 'Binding', 'IkappaB-alpha'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'MIP-1alpha'),('p65', 'Gene_expression', ' MIP-1alpha')

Our results support a novel mechanism of NF-kappaB activation via physical interaction of Tat with IkappaB-alpha and p65, and may contribute to further insights into the deregulation of the inflammatory response by HIV-1.
('Tat', 'Binding', 'IkappaB-alpha'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65')

The defective NF-kappaB activation by both stimuli suggests that the Sharpin mutation interferes with the protein adaptors or kinases shared by both signaling pathways, such as RIP1 and TRAF6 [18].
('Sharpin', 'Ubiquitination', 'RIP1')

Our results indicate that the protein HOIP is critical for CD40-induced signals that regulate B cell function.
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40')

Our data show that HOIP-dependent cellular responses include CD40-mediated upregulation of CD80 expression and synthesis of germline RNA transcripts from the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus, two events that are important for T-cell-dependent antibody-mediated immune responses.
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40')

At the molecular level, our data indicate that HOIP functions downstream of TRAF2 in the CD40 signaling pathway and that HOIP has a key role in promoting the recruitment of the IKK complex to CD40.
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40'),('TRAF2', 'Binding', 'HOIP')

Consistent with this, CD40-induced activation of NF-kappaB is dependent on the presence of HOIP.
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40')

In addition, our data show that HOIP facilitates the activation of JNK in response to CD40 engagement.
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40')

Together, our findings provide support for the conclusion that HOIP is a key component of the CD40 signaling pathway.
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40')

Given the importance of CD40 signaling in both cellular and humoral immune responses, our results indicate that HOIP has a critical role in the regulation of the immune system.
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40')

Subsequent studies showed that a HOIP-containing complex can interact with IKKgamma and facilitate activation of NF-kappaB via the canonical pathway [16].
('HOIP', 'Positive_regulation', 'IKKgamma')

These data, considered together with ours, suggest that a HOIP-containing complex mediates recruitment of IKKgamma to the CD40 signaling complex.
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40'),('HOIP', 'Positive_regulation', 'IKKgamma')

In addition, CD40-associated HOIP could play a role in activating IKKgamma after its recruitment to the signaling complex [16].
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40'),('HOIP', 'Positive_regulation', 'IKKgamma')

The higher molecular weight forms of IKKgamma we observed in CD40 immunoprecipitates would be consistent with the presence of post-transcriptional modifications including phosphorylation and ubiquitination, which have been suggested to reduce or enhance IKKgamma activity, respectively [16], [17].
('IKKgamma', 'Positive_regulation', 'IKKgamma'),('IKKgamma', 'Negative_regulation', 'IKKgamma')

The mechanisms by which HOIP mediates recruitment of the IKK complex to CD40 and by which HOIP is recruited to CD40 remain unclear.
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40')

A previous study indicates that HOIP may mediate direct contacts with the IKK complex [16], suggesting that it functions as an adaptor for the recruitment of the IKK complex to CD40.
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40')

As IKKgamma appears capable of binding linear polyubiquitin [18], [19], it is possible that HOIP directs formation of linear polyubiquitin chains on a CD40-associated factor, and it is these chains that serve to recruit IKKgamma to the CD40 signaling complex.
('IKKgamma', 'Positive_regulation', 'IKKgamma'),('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40'),('IKKgamma', 'Negative_regulation', 'IKKgamma'),('HOIP', 'Positive_regulation', 'IKKgamma')

The molecular interactions necessary for recruitment of HOIP itself to the CD40 signaling complex also remain to be fully characterized.
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40')

We previously showed that the recruitment of HOIP to the signaling complex is TRAF2-dependent [8].
('TRAF2', 'Binding', 'HOIP')

Potentially, TRAF2 and HOIP directly interact, but it is possible that the ubiquitin ligase activity of TRAF2 [20] (or TRAF2-associated proteins, such as the cIAPs [21]) generates K63-linked polyubiquitin chains to which HOIP can bind and thus associate with the CD40 signaling complex [22].
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40'),('TRAF2', 'Binding', 'HOIP')

While our previous work indicated a potentially important link between TRAF2 and HOIP in CD40 signaling, the signals and functions tested here are dependent upon TRAF6 as well as TRAF2.
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40'),('TRAF2', 'Binding', 'HOIP')

HOIP deficiency compromises the CD40-mediated activation of both NF-kappaB and JNK, indicating that signals mediated by both TRAF2 and TRAF6 likely pass through HOIP.
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40'),('TRAF2', 'Binding', 'HOIP')

Although the experiments presented here focus on CD40, our results and those of other groups [16], [22] support the possibility that HOIP is important in many signaling pathways in which TRAF2 or TRAF6 are involved, including those associated with various members of the TNF receptor superfamily and the Toll-like receptors.
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'CD40'),('TRAF2', 'Binding', 'HOIP')

GATA3 Represses the FOXP3 Promoter
('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

To investigate the molecular mechanism of GATA3-mediated repression of human FOXP3, the human FOXP3 promoter was studied and a palindromic binding site for GATA3 was discovered.
('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('FOXP3', 'Regulation', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

We transfected human primary CD4+ T cells, in vitro differentiated Th2 cells, and Jurkat cells (Jurkat cells are known to constitutively express GATA3 [25,26]), and we measured FOXP3 promoter activity.
('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

Overexpression of GATA3 in naive T cells diminished luciferase activity of the FOXP3 promoter compared with the control vector (Figure 8B).
('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

This mutation increased luciferase activity by 3-fold in memory CD4+CD45RO+ T cells, whereas no difference was observed in naive (GATA3-) CD4+CD45RA+ T cells, revealing a repressor activity of GATA3 on the FOXP3 promoter (Figure 8C).
('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

Furthermore GATA3 binds directly to the FOXP3 promoter as investigated by pull-down assay.
('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

HEK cells were transiently transfected with GATA3 or a control vector, and increasing amounts of lysates were incubated with oligonucleotides containing the GATA3 site of the FOXP3 promoter or a control oligonucleotide with a mutated GATA3-binding site.
('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

These experiments demonstrated that GATA3 binds the palindromic FOXP3 promoter.
('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

To gain insights into the in vivo situation, we performed a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) using an anti-GATA3 antibody and showed that GATA3 binds to the FOXP3 promoter region in Th2 cells, but not in iTreg cells (Figure 7F).
('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

Taken together these data demonstrate that the GATA3-binding to the FOXP3 promoter is repressing FOXP3 expression.

3.5 microg of the FOXP3 promoter luciferase reporter vector or a combination together with the RUNX1, RUNX3 pEGFPN1 vector, and 0.5 microg phRL-TK were added to 3 x 106 CD4+ T cells resuspended in 100 microl of Nucleofector solution (Lonza) and electroporated using the program U-15.

Costimulatory signals, such as activation of the CD28 cell surface molecule on T cells, lead to activation through a distinct region of the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) promoter.
('CD28', 'Positive_regulation', 'granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor')

We have found that the HTLV-1 transactivator protein, tax, acts as a costimulatory signal for GM-CSF and IL-2 gene transcription, in that it can cooperate with TCR signals to mediate high level gene expression.
('tax', 'Transcription', 'IL-2'),('tax', 'Transcription', 'GM-CSF')

In vitro human CD4+ and CD8+ T cell clones, or mouse CD4+ T cells that produce both interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and IL-10, can be differentiated by T cell receptor (TCR)-stimulation in the presence of IL-12 (Chang et al., 2007; Gerosa et al., 1996; Jeannin et al., 1996; Meyaard et al., 1996; Windhagen et al., 1996).
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma')

Th1 cell development requires signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)1 activation, induced by type I IFN or IFN-gamma, the transcription factor T-box 21 (T-bet), and IL-12-induced STAT4 signaling, which can couple with IL-18-induced IRAK and NF-kappaB transcription factors to drive the high amounts of IFN-gamma required to eradicate intracellular pathogens (Glimcher and Murphy, 2000).

The development of Th17 cells requires IL-6, TGF-beta, and the STAT3-dependent expression of the transcription factor RORgammat (Ivanov et al., 2007; Stockinger and Veldhoen, 2007).
('STAT3', 'Gene_expression', 'RORgammat')

Whereas high doses of antigen, with sustained TCR signaling and extracellular-signal regulated (ERK) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation, result in Th1 cells producing IFN-gamma via an IL-12-independent mechanism, low doses of antigen, with transient ERK1 and ERK2 activation, favor Th2 responses and IL-4 secretion (Constant et al., 1995; Hosken et al., 1995; Jorritsma et al., 2003; Yamane et al., 2005).
('ERK2', 'Localization', 'IL-4'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('ERK1', 'Localization', 'IL-4')

Here, we showed that in vitro differentiation of IL-10-producing Th1 cells from naive CD4+ T cells required IL-12-induced STAT4 signaling, strong TCR activation (high antigen dose), and sustained ERK1 and ERK2 phosphorylation.
('ERK1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('ERK2', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Furthermore, we showed that activation of ERK1 and ERK2 is a requirement for production of IL-10 by Th1, Th2, and Th17 cell subsets.

This study demonstrates that GC act as a primary inducer of sialoadhesin expression on rat macrophages, and that the response can be enhanced by IFN-beta, T cell-derived cytokines, or LPS.

It is generally accepted that Bcl-2 exerts its antiapoptotic effects mainly by dimerizing with proapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family such as Bax and Bad.
('Bcl-2', 'Binding', 'Bcl-2')

We have found that Bcl-2 overexpression leads to the prevention of chemotherapy (paclitaxel)-induced expression of FasL and blocks paclitaxel-induced apoptosis.
('Bcl-2', 'Gene_expression', 'FasL')

Furthermore, Bcl-2 antagonizes drug-induced apoptosis by inhibiting calcineurin activation, blocking NFAT nuclear translocation, and preventing FasL expression.
('Bcl-2', 'Gene_expression', 'FasL')

The effects of Bcl-2 can be overcome, at least partially, through phosphorylation of Bcl-2.
('Bcl-2', 'Binding', 'Bcl-2')

Phosphorylated Bcl-2 cannot bind calcineurin, and NFAT activation, FasL expression, and apoptosis can occur after Bcl-2 phosphorylation.

To understand the role of NF-kappa B complexes in T cell development and activation, we have generated transgenic mice in which RelA and c-Rel complexes were selectively inhibited in the T-lineage cells by specific expression of a trans-dominant form of I kappa B alpha.

IkappaBalpha degradation and RPS3 nuclear translocation
('IkappaBalpha', 'Binding', 'RPS3'),('IkappaBalpha', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

Since IkappaBalpha degradation is a prerequisite to unmask the NLS of p65, and both RPS3 and IkappaBalpha bind to p65 in the cytoplasmic inhibitory complex, we tested whether IkappaBalpha degradation is required for the liberation of RPS3.
('IkappaBalpha', 'Binding', 'RPS3'),('IkappaBalpha', 'Localization', 'RPS3'),('IkappaBalpha', 'Regulation', 'p65'),('RPS3', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

We measured the association of RPS3 with importin-alpha in 293T cells overexpressing wild-type IkappaBalpha or an IkappaBalpha mutant (SSAA) resistant to IKKbeta-induced phosphorylation and degradation.
('IkappaBalpha', 'Binding', 'RPS3'),('IkappaBalpha', 'Localization', 'RPS3'),('IKKbeta', 'Phosphorylation', 'IkappaBalpha'),('IKKbeta', 'Protein_catabolism', 'IkappaBalpha')

In cells transfected with wild-type IkappaBalpha, TNF stimulation augmented the interaction of RPS3 and importin-alpha to a similar degree as in non-transfected cells.
('IkappaBalpha', 'Binding', 'RPS3'),('IkappaBalpha', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

By contrast, we observed that the RPS3-importin-alpha association was abolished by the presence of non-degradable IkappaBalpha (Fig.
('IkappaBalpha', 'Binding', 'RPS3'),('IkappaBalpha', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

To examine whether IkappaBalpha is the only cytoplasmic barrier precluding RPS3 nuclear translocation, we measured both RPS3-importin-alpha association and nuclear RPS3 after reducing IkappaBalpha expression.
('IkappaBalpha', 'Binding', 'RPS3'),('IkappaBalpha', 'Localization', 'RPS3'),('RPS3', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

Moreover, cells treated with sodium pervanadate (Pv) to induce IkappaBalpha degradation through an IKK-independent mechanism25-27 did not show increased association between RPS3 and importin-alpha (Fig.
('IkappaBalpha', 'Binding', 'RPS3'),('IkappaBalpha', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

3b) or nuclear accumulation of RPS3, despite complete IkappaBalpha degradation (Supplementary Fig.
('IkappaBalpha', 'Binding', 'RPS3'),('IkappaBalpha', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

We further examined whether a subsequent NF-kappaB activation signal independently promotes the importin-alpha association and nuclear transport of RPS3 after IkappaBalpha degradation.
('IkappaBalpha', 'Binding', 'RPS3'),('IkappaBalpha', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

Thus, IkappaBalpha phosphorylation and degradation itself is required but not sufficient to cause RPS3 association with importin-alpha followed by nuclear translocation.

BMP-6 induces phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8
('BMP-6', 'Phosphorylation', 'Smad1'),('BMP-6', 'Phosphorylation', '5'),('BMP-6', 'Phosphorylation', '8')

Interestingly, treatment with 500 ng/ml BMP-6 induced phosphorylation of Smad.
('BMP-6', 'Phosphorylation', '5')

The BMP-6 induced phosphorylation was high at the earliest time point tested (15 minutes), and remained high for at least 48 hours (Figure 5).
('BMP-6', 'Phosphorylation', '5'),('BMP-6', 'Phosphorylation', '8')

However, we did not observe any significant changes in the level of phospho-STAT3 or phospho-p38 upon BMP-6 treatment of B cells (data not shown).

Although Foxp3 could down-regulate Tax-dependent transactivation of the HTLV-I LTR (Figure 4B) and inhibit Tax expression from an infectious molecular clone (Figure 5), Foxp3 failed to modulate Tax function in the absence of the viral promoter (Figure 4D).
('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

Therefore, we hypothesized that Foxp3 may inhibit Tax transactivation of the HTLV-I LTR via disruption of the CREB signaling pathway.
('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'Tax')

To test this possibility, HEK 293T cells were transfected with an HTLV-I LTR or synthetic CREB reporter vector along with a control expression vector (EGFP) or expression vectors encoding Foxp3 or deltaFKH.
('deltaFKH', 'Positive_regulation', 'CREB')

Like NF-kappaB activation, CREB transcriptional activation was also suppressed by expression of Foxp3, and to a similar extent deltaFKH, in healthy donor CD4+ T cells (Figure 6B).
('deltaFKH', 'Positive_regulation', 'CREB')

As observed with NF-kappaB activation, deltaFKH was a more potent inhibitor of CREB activation in CD4+ T cells than in HEK 293T cells, further indicating that a cell type-specific mechanism of action may govern the function of this Foxp3 mutant.
('deltaFKH', 'Positive_regulation', 'CREB')

However, Foxp3 failed to markedly affect transcriptional activation of Gal4-BD-c-Jun (c-Jun has also been demonstrated to bind to the HTLV-I LTR) and Gal4-BD-Tax (see Figure 5).

Interleukin-10 Production by Th1 Cells Requires Interleukin-12-Induced STAT4 Transcription Factor and ERK MAP Kinase Activation by High Antigen Dose
('ERK', 'Gene_expression', 'Interleukin-10'),('STAT4', 'Gene_expression', 'Interleukin-10')

We showed that development of IL-10-producing Th1 cells required high T cell receptor (TCR) ligation, sustained ERK1 and ERK2 MAP kinases phosphorylation, and IL-12-induced STAT4 transcription factor activation.
('ERK2', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'STAT4'),('ERK1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Although Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells require the activation of distinct STATs for their differentiation, activation of ERK1 and ERK2 was a common requirement for production of IL-10 by all Th cell subsets.

CD30-dependent degradation of TRAF2: implications for negative regulation of TRAF signaling and the control of cell survival.
('CD30', 'Protein_catabolism', 'TRAF2')

During CD30 signal transduction, we found that binding of TRAF2 to the cytoplasmic domain of CD30 results in the rapid depletion of TRAF2 and the associated protein TRAF1 by proteolysis.
('CD30', 'Protein_catabolism', 'TRAF2'),('TRAF2', 'Protein_catabolism', 'TRAF2')

These data suggest a model in which CD30 limits its own ability to transduce cell survival signals through signal-coupled depletion of TRAF2.

Nonpituitary human prolactin gene transcription is independent of Pit-1 and differentially controlled in lymphocytes and in endometrial stroma.
('Pit-1', 'Transcription', 'prolactin')

In order to delineate the tissue-specific mechanisms governing the control of nonpituitary PRL gene expression, we have cloned and sequenced 3 kb 5'-flanking DNA of the upstream decidual/lymphoid (dPRL) promoter.
('PR', 'Regulation', 'dPRL')

We focused our studies on the role of Pit-1 and of PR as potential transcriptional regulators, since the POU domain protein Pit-1 is essential in the control of pituitary PRL expression, and progesterone induces decidual transformation of the endometrial stroma, a differentiation process during which the decidual PRL gene is activated.
('Pit-1', 'Gene_expression', 'PRL')

We demonstrate in a variety of cell types, including lymphocytes and endometrial stroma, that Pit-1 is not involved in the regulation of dPRL promoter/reporter gene constructs carrying 3 kb 5'-flanking DNA.
('Pit-1', 'Gene_expression', 'PRL'),('PR', 'Regulation', 'dPRL')

Our experiments also show that activated PR does not confer direct transcriptional control on the dPRL promoter.
('PR', 'Regulation', 'dPRL')

When we compared the activity of the transfected dPRL promoter in PRL-secreting and nonsecreting lymphoid cells, we found that the 3 kb 5'-flanking region of the dPRL promoter did not contain elements restricting expression to only those lymphocytes that produce PRL but allowed expression of fusion reporter genes irrespective of the status of the endogenous PRL gene.
('PR', 'Regulation', 'dPRL')

This was in sharp contrast to endometrial cells where 3 kb 5'-flanking DNA conferred strong transcriptional activation on the dPRL promoter in decidualized endometrial stromal cells actively secreting PRL, but did not allow transcription in undifferentiated non-PRL-secreting endometrial stromal cells.
('PR', 'Regulation', 'dPRL')

Activation of the dPRL promoter construct in these undifferentiated cells could however be induced by the addition of cAMP, in the absence of progesterone, suggesting that a signal transduced through the cAMP signaling pathway is a primary inducer of decidual PRL gene expression.
('PR', 'Regulation', 'dPRL')

The interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) gene is both an immediate-early G1 phase gene and an S phase gene inducible by PRL in rat Nb2 T lymphocytes.
('PRL', 'Gene_expression', 'IRF-1')

To understand the mechanism by which PRL regulates the biphasic expression of IRF-1, we cloned the rat IRF-1 gene and functionally characterized the IRF-1 promoter.
('PRL', 'Gene_expression', 'IRF-1')

Upon transfection into Nb2 T cells, 1.7 kilobases (kb) of IRF-1 5'-flanking DNA linked to a chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) reporter gene mediated a 30-fold induction of CAT enzyme activity in response to 24 h of PRL stimulation.
('PRL', 'Gene_expression', 'IRF-1')

By assaying CAT enzyme activity across a 24-h PRL induction time course, we were able to assign G1 vs. S phase PRL responses of the IRF-1 gene to different regions of the IRF-1 5'-flanking and promoter DNA.
('PRL', 'Gene_expression', 'IRF-1')

Hence, the PRL-induced biphasic expression of the IRF-1 gene appears to be controlled by separate PRL-responsive elements: elements in the first 0.2 kb of the IRF-1 promoter region act during early activation, and elements between 0.2 and 1.7 kb act in concert with the proximal 0.2-kb region during S phase progression.
('PRL', 'Gene_expression', 'IRF-1')

In this study, we show that an activation-deficient glucocorticoid receptor mutant is as effective as the wild-type receptor in repression of AP-1 activity, inhibition of interleukin-2 production, inhibition of c-myc expression and induction of apoptosis.

The 3'-CAGGTG E-box could bind USF proteins, the ubiquitous repressor ZEB, or the basic helix-loop-helix proteins E2A and HEB, and we showed that a competition between ZEB and E2A/HEB proteins is involved in the silencer activity.
('ZEB', 'Binding', 'E2A'),('ZEB', 'Binding', 'HEB')

One of the essential proteins which bound to the enhancer was similar or identical to members of the C/EBP family of transcription factors required for both IL-1- and LPS-specific induction of the IL-6 gene (i.e., the NF-IL6 proteins).
('NF-IL6', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-6')

We also tested the impact of activating NF-kappaB by overexpressing IKKbeta on RPS3 nuclear translocation.
('IKKbeta', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3')

To examine the role of S209 phosphorylation of RPS3 to its NF-kappaB function6, 7, 30, we silenced endogenous RPS3 expression using an siRNA that targets the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) of RPS3 mRNA, followed by complementation with either wild-type or S209A mutant RPS3 via transfection.
('RPS3', 'Binding', 'RPS3'),('RPS3', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

As expected, RPS3 siRNA severely reduced endogenous RPS3 abundance compared to NS siRNA, but did not affect the robust expression of Flag-tagged RPS3 from a transfected construct lacking the 3' UTR (Fig.
('RPS3', 'Binding', 'RPS3'),('RPS3 siRNA', 'Gene_expression', 'Flag-tagged RPS3'),('RPS3', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

We also found that RPS3 knockdown reduced TNF-induced expression of an Ig kappaB-driven luciferase construct6 (Fig.
('RPS3', 'Negative_regulation', 'luciferase')

The impaired luciferase signal caused by RPS3 deficiency was completely restored by transfecting wild-type, but not by S209A RPS3 (Fig.
('RPS3', 'Binding', 'RPS3'),('RPS3', 'Negative_regulation', 'luciferase'),('RPS3', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

Moreover, the failure of S209A RPS3 to restore luciferase activity did not result from defective translation because the transient overexpression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) was comparable in cells complemented with wild-type or S029A RPS3 (Supplementary Fig.
('RPS3', 'Binding', 'RPS3'),('RPS3', 'Negative_regulation', 'luciferase'),('RPS3', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

We next used chromatin immunoprecipitation to determine whether S209 phosphorylation affects RPS3 and p65 recruitment to specific kappaB sites in intact chromatin during NF-kappaB activation.
('RPS3', 'Localization', 'p65'),('RPS3', 'Binding', 'p65')

In RPS3 knockdown cells, PMA+I stimulated the recruitment of ectopically expressed, Flag-tagged wild-type, but not S209A RPS3 to the kappaB sites of the NFKBIA and IL8 promoters (Fig.
('RPS3', 'Binding', 'RPS3'),('RPS3', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

While expressing RPS3 S209A had no impact on p65 nuclear translocation, it substantially attenuated p65 recruitment (Fig.
('RPS3', 'Localization', 'p65'),('RPS3', 'Binding', 'p65')

Additional experiments revealed that p65 attraction to RPS3-independent NF-kappaB target gene promoters such as CD25 was increased (Supplementary Fig.
('RPS3', 'Localization', 'p65'),('RPS3', 'Binding', 'p65')

There was no significant Flag-RPS3 or p65 recruitment to ACTB promoter lacking kappaB sites (Fig.
('RPS3', 'Localization', 'p65'),('RPS3', 'Binding', 'p65')

Thus, the recruitment of RPS3 as well as the contingent recruitment of p65 to key promoters depended on S209.
('RPS3', 'Localization', 'p65'),('RPS3', 'Binding', 'p65')

Interleukin 8 (IL-8) secretion induced by either T cell receptor (TCR) agonist stimulation or PMA+I was decreased as a consequence of reduced RPS3/p65 recruitment to the IL8 kappaB sites in the presence of S209A mutant compared to wild-type RPS3 (Supplementary Fig.
('RPS3', 'Binding', 'RPS3'),('RPS3', 'Localization', 'p65'),('RPS3', 'Binding', 'p65'),('RPS3', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

Therefore, RPS3 S209 phosphorylation by IKKbeta is apparently required for RPS3 in directing NF-kappaB to a specific subset of target genes.

('Tax', 'Phosphorylation', 'IkappaB alpha'),('Tax', 'Protein_catabolism', 'IkappaB alpha')

Our studies now demonstrate that HTLV-1 Tax activates the recently identified cellular kinases IkappaB kinase alpha (IKKalpha) and IKKbeta, which normally phosphorylate IkappaB alpha on both of its N-terminal regulatory serines in response to tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1 (IL-1) stimulation.

The Th2 cytokine IL-4 inhibits FOXP3 expression during T cell priming.

GATA3 binds to theFOXP3promoter and can repress the FOXP3 trans-activation process directly in Th2 cells (Mantel et al., 2007).
('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

It was further demonstrated that both Th1 and Th2 transcription factors T-bet and GATA3 oppose peripheral induction of Foxp3+T reg cells in mice through STAT1-, STAT4-, and STAT6-dependent pathways (Wei et al., 2007).

They include the crucial choices between cell-cycle exit and continued proliferation, as well as between cell differentiation and self-renewal (Blyth et al., 2005).Because of the involvement of RUNX mutations in different autoimmune diseases and the known interaction with TGF-beta, we investigated the impact of RUNX1 and RUNX3 on the expression of FOXP3 and subsequently on the development and function of iT reg cells.

Transcriptional regulation of the beta-casein gene by cytokines: cross-talk between STAT5 and other signaling molecules.
('STAT5', 'Gene_expression', 'beta-casein')

The beta-casein promoter has been widely used to monitor the activation of STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription)5 since STAT5 was originally found as a mediator of PRL-inducible beta-casein expression.
('STAT5', 'Gene_expression', 'beta-casein'),('PRL', 'Gene_expression', 'beta-casein')

However, not only is expression of the beta-casein gene regulated by STAT5 but it is also affected by other molecules such as glucocorticoid and Ras.
('STAT5', 'Gene_expression', 'beta-casein')

We have found that the beta-casein gene is expressed in a cytotoxic T cell line, CTLL-2, in response to interleukin-2 (IL-2), which activates STAT5.
('STAT5', 'Gene_expression', 'beta-casein'),('IL-2', 'Gene_expression', 'beta-casein')

beta-casein, a cytokine-inducible SH2-containing protein (CIS), and oncostatin M (OSM), suggesting that STAT6 activated by IL-4 substitutes for the function of STAT5 in T cells.
('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'OSM'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'CIS'),('STAT5', 'Gene_expression', 'beta-casein'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'beta-casein')

IL-2-induced beta-casein expression was enhanced by dexamethasone, and this synergistic effect of Dexamethasone requires the sequence between -155 and -193 in the beta-casein promoter.
('IL-2', 'Gene_expression', 'beta-casein')

Coincidentally, a deletion of this region enhanced the IL-2-induced expression of beta-casein.
('IL-2', 'Gene_expression', 'beta-casein')

Expression of an active form of Ras, Ras(G12V), suppressed the IL-2-induced beta-casein and OSM gene expression, and the negative effect of Ras is mediated by the region between -105 and -193 in the beta-casein promoter.
('Ras(G12V)', 'Positive_regulation', 'beta-casein'),('IL-2', 'Gene_expression', 'OSM'),('IL-2', 'Gene_expression', 'beta-casein')

In apparent contradiction, expression of a dominant negative form of Ras, RasN17, also inhibited IL-2-induced activation of the promoter containing the minimal beta-casein STAT5 element as well as the promoters of CIS and OSM.
('RasN17', 'Positive_regulation', 'CIS'),('RasN17', 'Positive_regulation', 'OSM'),('IL-2', 'Gene_expression', 'OSM'),('STAT5', 'Gene_expression', 'beta-casein'),('IL-2', 'Gene_expression', 'beta-casein')

In addition, Ras(G12V) complemented signaling by an erythropoietin receptor mutant defective in Ras activation and augmented the activation of the beta-casein promoter by the mutant erythropoietin receptor signaling, suggesting a possible role of Ras in Stat5-mediated gene expression.
('erythropoietin receptor', 'Positive_regulation', 'beta-casein'),('Ras(G12V)', 'Positive_regulation', 'beta-casein')

We now demonstrate that B7, but not LFA-3, strongly costimulated IL-2 transcription and mRNA expression in CD4+ T cells.
('B7', 'Transcription', 'IL-2'),('LFA-3', 'Transcription', 'IL-2')

Maximal increase in IL-2 transcription was recorded with CHO-DR/B7/LFA-3, suggesting a cooperative effect of B7 and LFA-3 at the transcriptional level.
('B7', 'Transcription', 'IL-2'),('LFA-3', 'Transcription', 'IL-2')

These may partly account for the differential effects of B7 and LFA-3 costimulation on IL-2 expression.

In this report, we demonstrate that one of the functions of CIITA is to recruit the CREB binding protein (CBP) to class II promoters.
('CIITA', 'Binding', 'CBP')

Not only functional but also specific binding interactions between CIITA and CBP were demonstrated.
('CIITA', 'Binding', 'CBP')

The functional interaction between Foxp3 and CREB did not affect the DNA-binding activity of CREB-1, but did show a modest decrease in activating transcription factor 2 (ATF-2) DNA-binding activity in the presence of forskolin as determined by transcription factor ELISA (Figure 7B).
('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'activating transcription factor 2'),('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'CREB-1')

To determine whether Foxp3 can disrupt the function/recruitment of the coactivator protein p300, we introduced a Gal4 reporter vector and a Gal4-BD-CREB-1 expression vector into HEK 293T cells in the absence or presence of Foxp3, p300, and/or control expression vectors (Figure 7C).
('p300', 'Transcription', 'Gal4-BD-CREB-1'),('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'CREB-1'),('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'p300'),('p300', 'Binding', 'p300'),('Foxp3', 'Positive_regulation', 'Gal4-BD-CREB-1')

As expected, p300 overexpression stimulated transcription of the Gal4-BD-CREB-1 fusion protein.
('p300', 'Transcription', 'Gal4-BD-CREB-1')

Foxp3, again, repressed basal levels of Gal4-BD-CREB-1 activation by more than 2-fold, while effectively neutralizing Gal4-BD-CREB-1 activation in the presence of p300.
('p300', 'Transcription', 'Gal4-BD-CREB-1'),('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'CREB-1'),('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'p300'),('Foxp3', 'Positive_regulation', 'Gal4-BD-CREB-1')

Overexpression of Foxp3 failed to reduce the detectable levels of CREB phosphorylation using a phosphospecific antibody for CREB-1 (unpublished data).
('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'CREB-1')

However, when we attempted to determine whether Foxp3 could physically interact with the coactivator protein p300, we found that p300 immunoprecipitated Foxp3 when both proteins were overexpressed in HEK 293T cells (Figure 7D).
('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'p300'),('p300', 'Binding', 'p300')

Collectively, these results suggest that Foxp3 antagonizes CREB-dependent gene expression by directly interacting with coactivator p300 and interfering with its function and/or recruitment to CREB-responsive promoter sequences.
('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'p300')

To explore the mechanism by which NleH1 inhibits RPS3 S209 phosphorylation, we first performed an in vitro kinase assay with purified wild-type His-NleH1 protein and a mutant His-NleH1 (K159A) protein, confirming that NleH1 is autophosphorylated and the K159A is an NleH1 kinase-dead mutant (Fig.
('NleH1', 'Phosphorylation', 'NleH1'),('NleH1', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('NleH1', 'Localization', 'RPS3'),('NleH', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('NleH', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

To examine whether the kinase activity is required for NleH1 to inhibit IKKbeta phosphorlyation of RPS3 on S209, we ectopically expressing either wild-type or K159A NleH1 in 293T cells.
('NleH1', 'Phosphorylation', 'NleH1'),('IKKbeta', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('NleH1', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('NleH1', 'Localization', 'RPS3'),('NleH', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('IKKbeta', 'Localization', 'RPS3'),('NleH', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

Wild-type NleH1 expression significantly reduced TNF-induced RPS3 S209 phosphorylation, whereas the K159A mutant failed to do so (Fig.
('TNF', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('NleH1', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('NleH1', 'Localization', 'RPS3'),('NleH', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('NleH', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

Thus NleH1 kinase activity is required to protect RPS3 from IKKbeta-mediated phosphorylation.

Citrobacter rodentium is a mouse pathogen that shares pathogenic strategies with E. coli 39, most notably for our investigation, C. rodentium NleH inhibited RPS3 nuclear translocation and RPS3-dependent NF-kappaB luciferase activity to an extent equivalent to E. coli NleH1 (ref.
('RPS3', 'Positive_regulation', 'luciferase'),('NleH1', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('NleH1', 'Localization', 'RPS3'),('NleH', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('NleH', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

In uninfected cells, TNF-treatment stimulated a ~3.5-fold increase in RPS3 S209 phosphorylation (Fig.
('TNF', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3')

However, RPS3 phosphorylation was enhanced when cells were infected with a C. rodentium strain lacking NleH (Fig.
('NleH', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('NleH', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

We further examined the role of NleH1 kinase activity using the C. rodentium deltanleH strain as a background on which to express either wild-type or K159A E. coli NleH1.
('NleH1', 'Phosphorylation', 'NleH1')

Complementing deltanleH mutant with wild-type NleH1 almost abolished TNF-induced RPS3 S209 phosphorylation whereas complementing with K159A failed to inhibit RPS3 phosphorylation (Fig.
('TNF', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('NleH1', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('NleH1', 'Localization', 'RPS3'),('NleH', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('NleH', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

Collectively, these results demonstrate that NleH1 kinase activity is required to block RPS3 S209 phosphorylation.
('NleH1', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('NleH1', 'Localization', 'RPS3'),('NleH', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('NleH', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

We next examined whether the inhibitory activity of NleH1 is sufficiently robust to impair the strong nuclear translocation of RPS3 trigged by the constitutively-active IKKbeta (IKKbeta [SSEE]) (Fig.
('IKKbeta', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('NleH1', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('NleH1', 'Localization', 'RPS3'),('NleH', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('IKKbeta', 'Localization', 'RPS3'),('NleH', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

We found that ectopically expressing either wild-type or SSEE IKKbeta proteins, triggered more RPS3 nuclear translocation than the kinase-dead IKKbeta (SSAA) protein (Fig.

In contrast, infecting with either deltanleH1 or deltaescN strains only slightly impaired RPS3 nuclear translocation in either IKKbeta- or IKKbeta (SSEE)-expressing cells (Fig.
('IKKbeta', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('IKKbeta', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

As expected, E. coli infections did not affect the RPS3 nuclear translocation in IKKbeta (SSAA)-expressing cells, where NF-kappaB signaling was low (Fig.
('IKKbeta', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('IKKbeta', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

Thus, during infection NleH1 is sufficiently potent to inhibit RPS3 nuclear translocation even in cells expressing constitutively-activated IKKbeta.
('IKKbeta', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('NleH1', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('NleH1', 'Localization', 'RPS3'),('NleH', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('IKKbeta', 'Localization', 'RPS3'),('NleH', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

We examined whether NleH1 could directly phosphorylate IKKbeta thus inhibiting IKKbeta-mediated RPS3 S209 phosphorylation.
('IKKbeta', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('NleH1', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('NleH1', 'Localization', 'RPS3'),('NleH', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('IKKbeta', 'Localization', 'RPS3'),('NleH', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

We performed in vitro kinase assays using immunoprecipitated Flag-IKKbeta (K44A) as substrate and recombinant His-NleH1 as kinase, so that IKKbeta autophosphorylation would not obscure NleH1-induced phosphorylation.
('NleH1', 'Phosphorylation', 'NleH1')

As expected, IKKbeta phosphorylated RPS3 (Fig.
('IKKbeta', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('IKKbeta', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

Preincubation of IKKbeta with NleH1 reduced IKKbeta-mediated RPS3 phosphorylation, i.e.
('IKKbeta', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('NleH1', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('NleH1', 'Localization', 'RPS3'),('NleH', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('IKKbeta', 'Localization', 'RPS3'),('NleH', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

the CK2 kinase specificity, but not IKKbeta-mediated GST-IkappaBalpha phosphorylation, i.e.
('IKKbeta', 'Phosphorylation', 'GST-IkappaBalpha')

Control experiments revealed no NleH1-mediated phosphorylation or autophosphorylation of RPS3 or GST-IkappaBalpha (Fig.
('NleH1', 'Phosphorylation', 'GST-IkappaBalpha'),('NleH1', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('NleH1', 'Localization', 'RPS3'),('NleH', 'Phosphorylation', 'RPS3'),('NleH', 'Localization', 'RPS3')

Taken together, NleH1 blocks the CK2 substrate specificity of IKKbeta thus inhibiting the IKKbeta-mediated RPS3 S209 phosphorylation thus representing a novel strategy by E. coli O157:H7 to alter the host innate immune response.

BMP-6 can signal through the ligation of the type I receptors Act-RIA, BMP-RIA, and BMP-RIB and the type II receptors BMP-RII, Act-RIIA and Act-RIIB, which lead to the phosphorylation of the receptor Smads (Smad-1, Smad-5, and Smad-8).
('BMP-6', 'Phosphorylation', 'Smad-1'),('BMP-6', 'Phosphorylation', 'Smad-8'),('BMP-6', 'Phosphorylation', 'Smad-5')

Furthermore, the expression of BMP receptors and BMP-6 induced activation of the Smad signalling pathway with subsequent regulation of the target genes Id1-Id4, were resolved.

The cell cycle-dependent transcription factor, E2F-1, regulates the cyclin-like species of the DNA repair enzyme uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG) gene in human osteosarcoma (Saos-2) cells.
('E2F-1', 'Positive_regulation', 'UDG')

We demonstrate, through the deletion of the human UDG promoter sequences, that expression of E2F-1 activates the UDG promoter through several E2F sites.
('E2F-1', 'Positive_regulation', 'UDG')

Here, we showed that Th1 cells required high-antigen-dose-induced ERK1 and ERK2 phosphorylation and IL-12-induced STAT-4 activation to produce IL-10.
('ERK1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('ERK', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'STAT-4'),('STAT-4', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('ERK2', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Our findings that ERK1 and ERK2 activation was a common pathway required for the production of IL-10 by Th1, Th2, and Th17 cell subsets, which differentiate along distinct pathways, such that IL-10 provides a highly regulated feedback loop to avoid the extremes of excessive inflammation or chronic infections and also allow a protective response to diverse pathogens.
('ERK1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('ERK', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('IL-10', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('ERK2', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Under these conditions, we speculate that Th1 cells will be induced to express high amounts of IL-10, in keeping with reports that IL-10-producing Th1 cells were found in CD4+ clones isolated from BAL but not blood of TB patients (Gerosa et al., 1999).
('IL-10', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Similarly, the immune response to a clinical isolate of L. major, which produces heavily infected nonhealing lesions, was found to be regulated by IL-10 derived from Foxp3- Th1 cells that coproduce IL-10 and IFN-gamma (Anderson et al., 2007), and the immune response during T. gondii infection was found also to be regulated by Foxp3- Th1 cells (Jankovic et al., 2007).
('IL-10', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IFN-gamma', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10')

It is likely that IL-10 production by Th1 cells is evoked under conditions of high inflammation and antigenic stimulation, whereas regulatory CD4+ T cells producing IL-10 may operate to regulate the immune response under conditions in which the pathogen is clinically controlled, such as in infection with L. major (Friedlin strain) (Belkaid et al., 2002; Suffia et al., 2006).
('IL-10', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

We now also reported that CD4+ T cells cultured with high antigen dose and IL-12 differentiate into canonical Th1 effector cells, which, in addition to expressing large amounts of IFN-gamma and IL-10, lose their IL-2 expression as described before in certain chronic infection models (Sallusto et al., 2004).
('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('IFN-gamma', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

We showed here that this induction of IL-10 in Th1 cells in vivo was markedly, but not totally, reduced in STAT4-deficient T cells as observed during T. gondii infection (Jankovic et al., 2002).
('STAT4', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10')

A high antigenic activation during T. gondii infection or high antigen doses delivered in the presence of LPS, as seen in our system, may compensate for an absolute requirement for IL-12 in the induction of IL-10 by Th1 cells.
('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

In our in vitro system, repeated stimulation of Th1 cells with high antigen doses allowed the development of Th1 cells producing IL-10 in an IL-12-dependent manner.
('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

IL-10 production by Th1 cells induced by high antigen dose and IL-12 was independent of IFN-gamma, in keeping with previous findings (Jankovic et al., 2002).
('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('IFN-gamma', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

However, a role for IFN-gamma in mediating IL-10 reactivation by Th1 cells during secondary infection with T. gondii has been suggested (Shaw et al., 2006).
('IFN-gamma', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10')

We have found that CD4+ T cells exposed to a high dose of antigen do not express IL-10 upon restimulation, but can be induced to produce IL-10 upon re-exposure to a high dose of antigen in the recall phase in the absence of added IL-12.
('IL-10', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

The combination of both high antigen dose and IL-12 resulted in the highest levels of IL-10 production and correlated with the high levels of ERK1 and ERK2 activation.
('ERK1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('ERK', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('ERK2', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

It is thus likely that in T. gondii infection in vivo (Shaw et al., 2006), the requirement for IFN-gamma to induce IL-10, was for feedback upregulation of IL-12 by DCs, which in turn induced IL-10 in the Th1 cells.
('IL-10', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('IFN-gamma', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Costimulatory OX-40 signals have been shown to negatively regulate IL-10 production (Ito et al., 2005) both in Th1 and Th2 cells, whereas ICOS signaling has been suggested to induce IL-10 (Ito et al., 2007; Witsch et al., 2002) in both Th1 and Th2 cells.
('IL-10', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

We now provide a common mechanism of ERK1 and ERK2 activation for the regulation of IL-10 production in Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells, although each subset differentiates along a distinct and subset-specific transcriptional pathway.
('ERK1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('ERK', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('ERK2', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Of note, a role for ERK1 and ERK2 activation in the induction of IL-10 production has already been described for macrophages and DC (Agrawal et al., 2006; Hacker et al., 1999).
('ERK1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('ERK', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('ERK2', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Differential transcriptional regulation of IL-10 in Th1 and Th2 cells has been suggested (Chang et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2005), and extensive histone acetylation of the IL-10 gene is detectable in fully polarized Th2 cells, but not Th1 cells (Chang et al., 2007).
('IL-10', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

We provide evidence that IL-10 is produced in canonical Th1 cells and that its expression correlates with the expression of T-bet and the highest IFN-gamma production, in keeping with our observations that high-dose antigen stimulation and IL-12 signaling are required for IL-10 and IFN-gamma expression.
('IL-10', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('IFN-gamma', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

It has also been shown that maintenance of IL-10 expression is conditional on IL-12 or IL-4 unless the IL-10 gene is imprinted by GATA-3 (Chang et al., 2007), which can remodel the IL-10 locus, thus explaining the highest amounts of IL-10 produced by Th2 cells (Chang et al., 2007; Shoemaker et al., 2006).
('IL-10', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

We show here that high antigen dose and IL-12 drastically downregulate Gata-3 expression, suggesting that additional factors are in place to induce IL-10 expression in Th1 cells, albeit transiently.
('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'Gata-3'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Expression of c-maf was greatly diminished by high antigen doses in T cells and yet was unexpectedly maintained by IL-12 and present in Th17 cells.
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'c-maf')

That c-maf expression is common to IL-10-producing Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells and, like IL-10, is dependent on ERK activation in Th1 and Th17 cells for its expression is of interest because c-Maf has been shown to be an essential transcription factor for IL-10 expression in macrophages (Cao et al., 2005).
('ERK', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('IL-10', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('ERK', 'Gene_expression', 'c-maf'),('c-Maf', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

ERK1 and ERK2 activation is required for IL-10 production by all these Th cell subsets.
('ERK1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('ERK', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('ERK2', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

With regard to the expression of IL-10 by Th1 cells, our data provide a mechanism for how IL-10 expression is induced and then amplified and regulated by the levels of antigen and IL-12 encountered in the environment.
('IL-10', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Increased expression of wild-type NFAT1 substantially increases IL-4 promoter activity in unprimed CD4 T cells, suggesting NFAT1 may be limiting for IL-4 gene expression in this cell type.
('NFAT1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-4'),('NFAT1', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-4'),('IL-4', 'Binding', 'IL-4')

Furthermore, a truncated form of NFAT1 acts as a dominant-negative, reducing IL-4 promoter activity in primed CD4 T cells and confirming the importance of endogenous NFAT to increased IL-4 gene expression by effector T cells.
('NFAT1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-4'),('NFAT1', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-4'),('IL-4', 'Binding', 'IL-4')

NFAT1 appears to be the major NFAT family member responsible for the initial increased expression of IL-4 by primed CD4 T cells.

The role of RUNX1 and RUNX3 transcription factors in TGF-beta-mediated iT reg cell generation
('TGF-beta', 'Transcription', 'RUNX1'),('TGF-beta', 'Transcription', 'RUNX3')

Stimulation with anti-CD2/3/28 mAbs or TGF-beta alone resulted in a minimal up-regulation of RUNX1 and RUNX3 mRNA (Fig.
('TGF-beta', 'Transcription', 'RUNX1'),('TGF-beta', 'Transcription', 'RUNX3')

In contrast, the combination of both TGF-beta and anti-CD2/3/28 mAbs induced RUNX1 and RUNX3 mRNAs, as well as FOXP3 mRNA, within 48 h in naive CD4+ T cells.
('RUNX3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Transcription', 'RUNX1'),('RUNX', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Transcription', 'RUNX3'),('RUNX1', 'Transcription', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX3', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX3', 'Transcription', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Transcription', 'FOXP3')

Deficiency of RUNX1 or RUNX3 resulted in markedly reduced TGF-beta-mediated induction of FOXP3 mRNA in naive CD4+ T cells compared with control cells transfected with scrambled siRNA.
('RUNX3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Transcription', 'RUNX1'),('RUNX', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Transcription', 'RUNX3'),('RUNX1', 'Transcription', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX3', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX3', 'Transcription', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Transcription', 'FOXP3')

The level of FOXP3 mRNA was further reduced when both RUNX1 and RUNX3 were knocked down in naive CD4+ T cells during their differentiation to iT reg cells (Fig.
('RUNX3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Transcription', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX3', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX3', 'Transcription', 'FOXP3')

We observed no change in GATA3 expression in Th2 cells, T-bet expression in Th1 cells, or RORC2 mRNA expression in Th17 cells in which RUNX1 and RUNX3 were knocked down compared with control cells.
('RUNX1', 'Transcription', 'T-bet'),('RUNX3', 'Transcription', 'GATA3'),('RUNX1', 'Transcription', 'GATA3'),('RUNX1', 'Transcription', 'RORC2'),('RUNX3', 'Transcription', 'T-bet'),('RUNX3', 'Transcription', 'RORC2')

On the contrary, FOXP3 mRNA was significantly decreased in RUNX1- and RUNX3-deficient T reg cells compared with control cells (Fig.
('RUNX3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Transcription', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX3', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX3', 'Transcription', 'FOXP3')

The effect of RUNX silencing on the expression level of intracellular FOXP3 during naive CD4+ T cell differentiation to iT reg was evaluated by flow cytometry.
('RUNX', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

FOXP3 was only slightly reduced after RUNX1 silencing.
('RUNX', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Transcription', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3')

The most striking FOXP3 reduction was observed when RUNX1 and RUNX3 were silenced together (Fig.
('RUNX3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Transcription', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX3', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX3', 'Transcription', 'FOXP3')

The increased impact of combined RUNX1 and RUNX3 knockdown implies that RUNX1 and RUNX3 might have redundant functions in the induction of FOXP3.
('RUNX3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Transcription', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX3', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX3', 'Transcription', 'FOXP3')

In addition, the levels of IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-13, and IFN-gamma in control siRNA-transfected or RUNX1 and RUNX3 siRNA-transfected CD4+ T cells that were cultured with or without anti-CD2/3/28 mAb and TGF-beta did not show any significant difference (Fig.
('RUNX1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-13'),('RUNX3', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('RUNX3', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('RUNX3', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-5'),('RUNX3', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-4'),('RUNX1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-5'),('RUNX1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-4'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-4'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-13'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-5'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('RUNX1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('TGF-beta', 'Transcription', 'RUNX1'),('TGF-beta', 'Transcription', 'RUNX3'),('RUNX1', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('RUNX3', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-13')

As expected, IL-10, TGF-beta, and FOXP3 mRNAs are also expressed in circulating T reg cells (Fig.
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('TGF-beta', 'Transcription', 'FOXP3')

Staining of tonsil sections for FOXP3 and RUNX3 demonstrated in vivo coexpression of these two molecules in a subset of T reg cells, whereas there was low RUNX1 expression in all tonsil cells (Fig.
('RUNX3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Transcription', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX3', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX3', 'Transcription', 'FOXP3')

Studies included structural comparison of the promoters for human and mouse inducible NO synthase (iNOS) genes, transfection and assay of human and mouse iNOS promoter regions in response to LPS +/- IFN-gamma, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays of kappa B response elements.
('IFN-gamma', 'Gene_expression', 'iNOS')

Two explanations for hyporesponsiveness of the human iNOS promoter to LPS +/- IFN-gamma were found: (1) multiple inactivating nucleotide substitutions in the human counterpart of the enhancer element that has been shown to regulate LPS/IFN-gamma induced expression of the mouse iNOS gene; and (2) and absence of one or more nuclear factors in human macrophages (e.g., an LPS-inducible nuclear factor-kappa B/Rel complex), that is (are) required for maximal expression of the gene.
('IFN-gamma', 'Gene_expression', 'iNOS')

Finally, comparison of the percent Foxp3+CD4+CD25+ T cells to the HTLV-I proviral load in HTLV-I-infected asymptomatic carriers and patients with HTLV-I-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis suggested that high Foxp3 expression is associated with low proviral load and absence of disease.
('Foxp3', 'Localization', 'Foxp3'),('Foxp3', 'Binding', 'Foxp3')

In the present study, analysis of the interleukin-2 (IL-2) gene activation shows that naive human helper T cells (cord blood CD4+ T cells, adult CD4+CD45RO- T cells) regulate IL-2 transcription by a mechanism involving both a silencer and an activator acting on the purine-rich IL-2 promoter elements (NF-AT binding sites).
('IL-2', 'Transcription', 'IL-2')

The small heat shock protein HSP27 has recently been proposed as a PKD1 substrate [24] and we accordingly assessed whether PKD-null DT40 cells have defective phosphorylation of HSP27 on serine 82, the proposed PKD1 substrate sequence.
('PKD1', 'Phosphorylation', 'HSP27')

We initially investigated the regulation of HSP27 phosphorylation in single knockout DT40 B cells lacking either PKD1 or PKD3.
('PKD1', 'Phosphorylation', 'HSP27'),('PKD3', 'Phosphorylation', 'HSP27')

BCR and phorbol ester signals were also able to increase HSP27 phosphorylation in PKD1 or PKD3 single knockout DT40 B cells (Fig.
('PKD1', 'Phosphorylation', 'HSP27'),('PKD3', 'Phosphorylation', 'HSP27')

However, BCR- and phorbol ester-induced phosphorylation of HSP27 on S82 was abolished in B cells that lacked both PKD1 and PKD3 (Fig.
('PKD1', 'Phosphorylation', 'HSP27'),('PKD3', 'Phosphorylation', 'HSP27')

Significantly, doxycycline-induced expression of the Flag-PKD3 transgene in the double knockout cells was sufficient to restore normal regulation of HSP27 phosphorylation (Fig.
('PKD3', 'Phosphorylation', 'HSP27')

In contrast, expression of a kinase-deficient PKD3 mutant protein in the double knockout cells was not able to restore BCR- or phorbol ester-induced HSP27 phosphorylation (Fig.
('PKD3', 'Phosphorylation', 'HSP27')

Hence, PKD3 as well as PKD1 can regulate HSP27 phosphorylation and in DT40 B cells they are functionally redundant as HSP27 kinases.
('PKD1', 'Phosphorylation', 'HSP27'),('PKD3', 'Phosphorylation', 'HSP27')

IL-7 reconstitutes multiple aspects of v-Abl-mediated signaling.
('IL-7', 'Positive_regulation', 'v-Abl')

Previous studies have shown constitutive activation of IL-4 and IL-7 signaling pathways, as measured by activation of Janus protein kinase (JAK)1, JAK3, STAT5, and STAT6, in pre-B cells transformed by v-Abl.
('IL-7', 'Positive_regulation', 'v-Abl')

To determine whether activation of these cytokine signaling pathways by v-Abl is important in the cellular events induced by the Abelson murine leukemia virus, the effects of IL-4 and IL-7 on pre-B cells transformed with a temperature-sensitive v-Abl mutant were examined.
('IL-7', 'Positive_regulation', 'v-Abl')

Whereas IL-4 had little or no effect, IL-7 delayed both the apoptosis and cell cycle arrest that occur upon v-Abl kinase inactivation.
('IL-7', 'Positive_regulation', 'v-Abl')

IL-7 also delayed the decreases in the levels of c-Myc, Bcl-2, and Bcl-xL that occur upon loss of v-Abl kinase activity.
('IL-7', 'Negative_regulation', 'Bcl-2'),('IL-7', 'Negative_regulation', 'c-Myc'),('IL-7', 'Negative_regulation', 'Bcl-xL'),('IL-7', 'Positive_regulation', 'v-Abl')

IL-7 did not maintain v-Abl-mediated differentiation arrest of the pre-B cells, as activation of NF-kappaB and RAG gene transcription was unaffected by IL-7.
('IL-7', 'Positive_regulation', 'v-Abl')

These results identify a potential role for IL-7 signaling pathways in transformation by v-Abl while demonstrating that a combination of IL-4 and IL-7 signaling cannot substitute for an active v-Abl kinase in transformed pre-B cells.
('IL-7', 'Positive_regulation', 'v-Abl')

IL-10 Production Is Maintained by High TCR Signal Strength and IL-12
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10')

We next investigated whether repeated strong TCR activation is a compensatory signal for IL-12-induced STAT4 signaling in the induction of IL-10 in Th1 cells.
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10')

High antigen dose and IL-12 cooperated to induce maximal IL-10 production (Figures 4A and 4B), given that this combination resulted in the highest numbers of IL-10-producing Th1 cells.
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10')

Repeated high antigen dose stimulation in the absence of exogenously added IL-12 resulted in the production of IL-10 by Th1 cells, suggesting that repeated strong TCR triggering may overcome the need for IL-12 for IL-10 induction (Figures 4C and 4D).
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10')

However, IL-10 induction under these conditions was abrogated when IL-12p40-deficient DCs were used as APCs (Figure4E).
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12p40', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10')

Thus, IL-12 is essential during both primary and secondary antigenic stimulation for production of IL-10 by Th1 cells.
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10')

To determine the requirements for stability of the IL-10-producing Th1 cells, we differentiated CD4+ Tcells for 1 week with high antigen doses with or without IL-12 (Figures 4A and 4C), washed them, and then restimulated them for an additional week with a low antigen dose, in the absence or presence of IL-12 (Figure4F).
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10')

Th1 cells induced in the first week to produce IL-10 by culture with high antigen doses and IL-12 lost their ability to express IL-10 when recultured with low doses of OVA, which could be compensated for, to some extent, by addition of IL-12 to the secondary cultures (Figure4F), again suggesting that antigen dose and IL-12 signals cooperate for the induction of IL-10.
('OVA', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10')

Finally, DO11.10 CD4+ cells that were exposed to low doses of antigen and IL-12 during the primary differentiation phase produced high amounts of IFN-gamma but little IL-10, but they could be induced to produce IL-10 when both high antigen dose and IL-12 were present during the recall phase (FigureS4).
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10')

Thus, high antigen dose and IL-12 are required for sustaining the induction of IL-10 production by Th1 cells.

The T-box transcription factors T-bet and Eomes have been linked to the regulation of genes encoding effector cytokines (e.g., Ifng) and genes important for cytolytic function (e.g., Prf1 and GzmB) (20).
('Eomes', 'Regulation', 'Prf1'),('Eomes', 'Regulation', 'Ifng'),('Eomes', 'Regulation', 'GzmB'),('T-bet', 'Regulation', 'GzmB'),('T-bet', 'Regulation', 'Prf1'),('T-bet', 'Regulation', 'Ifng')

T-bet mRNA expression slightly preceded the expression of GzmB mRNA; similarly, Eomes mRNA and protein were expressed ~1 d ahead of the reexpression of perforin mRNA and protein, respectively (Fig.
('Eomes', 'Regulation', 'GzmB'),('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('T-bet', 'Regulation', 'GzmB')

T-bet is required early for IFN-gamma production, and our data suggested that Eomes might not function during this early period but rather might contribute later to the control of perforin expression.
('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma')

Our data seemed most consistent with a model in which TCR signals induce T-bet, which in turn induces IFN-gamma (17) and possibly granzyme B; subsequently, Eomes is induced during the period of clonal expansion in IL-2 and activates perforin expression.
('Eomes', 'Gene_expression', 'perforin'),('T-bet', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma')

Fusion of subdomains of BOB.1/OBF.1 with the GAL4 DNA binding domain reveals that both NH2- and COOH-terminal domains of BOB.1/OBF.1 contribute to full transactivation function, the COOH-terminal domain is more efficient in this transactivation assay.
('BOB.1', 'Binding', 'BOB.1')

The CD4+CD25-, CD45RA+, CD45RO+, and CD4+CD45RO+CD25- were able to significantly induce FOXP3 mRNA up to 30-fold upon TCR activation and addition of TGF-beta.
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

Th2 cells are known to produce IL-4 upon activation, which may interact with TGF-beta signaling and thus prevent FOXP3 induction.
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

However, the neutralization of IL-4 with a blocking IL-4 antibody did not rescue FOXP3 expression in the differentiated Th2 cells (unpublished data).
('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

Repeated exposure to TGF-beta did not further increase the FOXP3 expression in the iTreg lineage but transiently induced FOXP3 expression in Th1 cells.
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

Naturally occurring Th2 cells such as CRTH2+ T cells, T cells isolated according to their IL-4 secretion, or an IL-4-producing T cell clone (BR8) were also lacking FOXP3 expression (Figure 2B).
('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

Furthermore TGF-beta-mediated FOXP3 induction failed in these cells in contrast to the naive T cells (Figure 2B).
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

Because IL-4 is the key Th2 cytokine, the expression of IL-4 and FOXP3 in freshly isolated CD4+ T cells was analyzed by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS).
('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

IL-4-expressing cells were most abundant among CD45RO+CD25- cells, which did not co-express FOXP3 (Figure 3A, left panel).
('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

In contrast, CD45RO+CD25+ cells abundantly expressed FOXP3, while lacking IL-4 (Figure 3A, right panel).
('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

As shown in Figure 3B, the frequency of the IL-4+ cells was always below 1% in the FOXP3+ cells close to the background.
('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

The IL-4+ cells were confined to the FOXP3- cells, as shown for the CD45RO+CD25-, CD45RO+CD25+, and CD45RO+CD25+high cells (Figure 3B).
('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

Cells enriched for their IL-4 secretion using the magnetic cell isolation technology contained some FOXP3-expressing cells, but importantly, the expression did not overlap.
('IL-4', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('IL-4', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

We also show that mitogen induction of the interleukin-1 beta converting enzyme (ICE) gene, a mammalian homologue of the Caenorhabditis elegans cell death gene ced-3, is IRF-1-dependent.
('IRF-1', 'Positive_regulation', 'ICE')

Ectopic overexpression of IRF-1 results in the activation of the endogenous gene for ICE and enhances the sensitivity of cells to radiation-induced apoptosis.
('IRF-1', 'Positive_regulation', 'ICE')

V3-BH10 neither blocked radiolabeled IL-2 binding to IL-2 receptors nor affected tyrosyl phosphorylation of several cellular proteins (p120, p98, p96, p54, and p38), which is immediately induced by IL-2 stimulation.
('IL-2', 'Phosphorylation', 'p96'),('IL-2', 'Phosphorylation', 'p54'),('IL-2', 'Phosphorylation', 'p98'),('IL-2', 'Phosphorylation', 'p38'),('IL-2', 'Phosphorylation', 'p120')

However, V3-BH10 enhanced IL-2-induced mRNA expression of c-fos but not c-myc or junB.
('IL-2', 'Transcription', 'junB'),('IL-2', 'Transcription', 'c-fos'),('IL-2', 'Transcription', 'c-myc')

Thus, the binding of V3 loop of gp120 to the cell surface molecule(s) appears to affect intracellular IL-2 signaling, which leads to the suppression of IL-2-induced T cell growth.
('IL-2', 'Phosphorylation', 'p120')

We report here that interleukin 2 (IL-2) acts on human blood monocytes by enhancing binding activity of the transcription factor NF-kappa B to its consensus sequence in the 5' regulatory enhancer region of the IL-2 receptor alpha chain (p55).
('IL-2', 'Binding', 'IL-2 receptor alpha chain')

Enhanced NF-kappa B binding activity is followed by functional activation in that inducibility of the IL-2 receptor alpha chain is mediated by enhanced NF-kappa B binding and that a heterologous promoter containing the NF-kappa B consensus sequence (-291 to -245) of the IL-2 receptor alpha chain gene is activated.
('IL-2', 'Binding', 'IL-2 receptor alpha chain')

In addition, IL-2 is capable of increasing transcript levels of the p50 gene coding for the p50 subunit of the NF-kappa B transcription factor, whereas mRNA levels of the p65 NF-kappa B gene remained unchanged.

The role of RUNX1 and RUNX3 transcription factors in TGF-beta-mediated iT reg cell generation
('TGF-beta', 'Transcription', 'RUNX1'),('TGF-beta', 'Transcription', 'RUNX3')

Stimulation with anti-CD2/3/28 mAbs or TGF-beta alone resulted in a minimal up-regulation of RUNX1 and RUNX3 mRNA (Fig.
('TGF-beta', 'Transcription', 'RUNX1'),('TGF-beta', 'Transcription', 'RUNX3')

In contrast, the combination of both TGF-beta and anti-CD2/3/28 mAbs induced RUNX1 and RUNX3 mRNAs, as well as FOXP3 mRNA, within 48 h in naive CD4+ T cells.
('RUNX3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Transcription', 'RUNX1'),('RUNX', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Transcription', 'RUNX3'),('RUNX1', 'Transcription', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX3', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX3', 'Transcription', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Transcription', 'FOXP3')

Deficiency of RUNX1 or RUNX3 resulted in markedly reduced TGF-beta-mediated induction of FOXP3 mRNA in naive CD4+ T cells compared with control cells transfected with scrambled siRNA.
('RUNX3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Transcription', 'RUNX1'),('RUNX', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Transcription', 'RUNX3'),('RUNX1', 'Transcription', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX3', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX3', 'Transcription', 'FOXP3'),('TGF-beta', 'Transcription', 'FOXP3')

The level of FOXP3 mRNA was further reduced when both RUNX1 and RUNX3 were knocked down in naive CD4+ T cells during their differentiation to iT reg cells (Fig.
('RUNX3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Transcription', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX3', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX3', 'Transcription', 'FOXP3')

We observed no change in GATA3 expression in Th2 cells, T-bet expression in Th1 cells, or RORC2 mRNA expression in Th17 cells in which RUNX1 and RUNX3 were knocked down compared with control cells.
('RUNX1', 'Transcription', 'T-bet'),('RUNX3', 'Transcription', 'GATA3'),('RUNX1', 'Transcription', 'GATA3'),('RUNX1', 'Transcription', 'RORC2'),('RUNX3', 'Transcription', 'T-bet'),('RUNX3', 'Transcription', 'RORC2')

On the contrary, FOXP3 mRNA was significantly decreased in RUNX1- and RUNX3-deficient T reg cells compared with control cells (Fig.
('RUNX3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Transcription', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX3', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX3', 'Transcription', 'FOXP3')

The effect of RUNX silencing on the expression level of intracellular FOXP3 during naive CD4+ T cell differentiation to iT reg was evaluated by flow cytometry.
('RUNX', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

FOXP3 was only slightly reduced after RUNX1 silencing.
('RUNX', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Transcription', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3')

The most striking FOXP3 reduction was observed when RUNX1 and RUNX3 were silenced together (Fig.
('RUNX3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Transcription', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX3', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX3', 'Transcription', 'FOXP3')

The increased impact of combined RUNX1 and RUNX3 knockdown implies that RUNX1 and RUNX3 might have redundant functions in the induction of FOXP3.
('RUNX3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Transcription', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX3', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX3', 'Transcription', 'FOXP3')

In addition, the levels of IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-13, and IFN-gamma in control siRNA-transfected or RUNX1 and RUNX3 siRNA-transfected CD4+ T cells that were cultured with or without anti-CD2/3/28 mAb and TGF-beta did not show any significant difference (Fig.
('RUNX1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-13'),('RUNX3', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('RUNX3', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('RUNX3', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-5'),('RUNX3', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-4'),('RUNX1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-5'),('RUNX1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-4'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-4'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-13'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-5'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('RUNX1', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('TGF-beta', 'Transcription', 'RUNX1'),('TGF-beta', 'Transcription', 'RUNX3'),('RUNX1', 'Gene_expression', 'IFN-gamma'),('RUNX3', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-13')

As expected, IL-10, TGF-beta, and FOXP3 mRNAs are also expressed in circulating T reg cells (Fig.
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('TGF-beta', 'Transcription', 'FOXP3')

Staining of tonsil sections for FOXP3 and RUNX3 demonstrated in vivo coexpression of these two molecules in a subset of T reg cells, whereas there was low RUNX1 expression in all tonsil cells (Fig.
('RUNX3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Transcription', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX3', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX1', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('RUNX3', 'Transcription', 'FOXP3')

To define the requirements of Foxp3 with respect to inhibition of NF-kappaB-dependent transcription, we utilized a mutant of Foxp3 lacking the FKH domain (Figure 2A) [16], similar to the scurfy mutant Foxp3 of mice, and a mutant Foxp3 protein from a patient with IPEX [4,11,14,17].
('Foxp3', 'Localization', 'Foxp3')

Although Foxp3 interaction with NF-kappaB presumably takes place in the nucleus, it may also be possible for a cytoplasmic Foxp3 protein to bind to NF-kappaB in the cytoplasm and prevent localization to the nucleus following an activation stimulus.
('Foxp3', 'Localization', 'Foxp3')

Western blot analysis of NF-kappaB p65 expression demonstrated that Foxp3 and deltaFKH does not block NF-kappaB activation at the level of p65 protein expression (Figure 2E).
('deltaFKH', 'Gene_expression', 'p65'),('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'p65')

These results are very interesting with respect to Foxp3 function, because they suggest that the carboxyl-terminal FKH domain, and possibly nuclear localization, are dispensable for Foxp3 function in T cell populations.

Cooperation of binding sites for STAT6 and NF kappa B/rel in the IL-4-induced up-regulation of the human IgE germline promoter.
('IL-4', 'Binding', 'STAT6'),('STAT6', 'Positive_regulation', 'IgE')

In the case of IgE class switching, IL-4 activates the IgE germline promoter by inducing the interaction of the transcription factor STAT6 (IL-4STAT) with a responsive DNA element in the proximal region of the promoter.
('IL-4', 'Binding', 'STAT6'),('STAT6', 'Positive_regulation', 'IgE')

In addition, the combination of a NF kappa B/rel binding site and the STAT6 response element conferred IL-4 inducibility to a heterologous minimal promoter, while the individual sites had no effect.
('IL-4', 'Binding', 'STAT6')

The available data suggest that the NF kappa B2 nucleoprotein complex may cooperate with DNA-bound STAT6 to achieve IL-4-dependent activation of the human IgE germline gene.

Co-stimulation of T-lymphocytes by T-cell receptor (TcR) occupancy and activation of the CD28 surface molecule results in enhanced proliferation and interleukin 2 (IL-2) production.
('CD28', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2')

The increase in IL-2 gene expression triggered by CD28 involves a kappa B-like sequence in the 5'-regulatory region of the IL-2 promoter, called CD28-responsive element.

Sp1 is a critical factor for the monocytic specific expression of human CD14.
('Sp1', 'Gene_expression', 'CD14')

The Sp1 transcription factor bound to three different regions in the CD14 promoter.
('Sp1', 'Gene_expression', 'CD14')

Mutation of the major Sp1 binding site (-110 bp) decreased tissue-specific promoter activity, and these results, together with transactivation experiments, demonstrate that Sp1 plays a critical role in the tissue-specific expression of CD14 in monocytic cells.
('Sp1', 'Gene_expression', 'CD14')

CD14 Sp1 site oligonucleotides bound preferentially to a 105-kDa Sp1 species, which is present in higher relative levels in monocytic than non-monocytic cells, suggesting that modification of Sp1, such as phosphorylation, may explain how the Sp1 site mediates monocytic specific promoter activity.

We evaluated the ability of eosinophil granule major basic protein (MBP) to stimulate interleukin (IL)-8 production by neutrophils.
('MBP', 'Gene_expression', 'interleukin (IL)-8')

MBP over the concentration range of 0.1 to 10 microM stimulated the release of up to approximately 8 ng/ml IL-8.
('MBP', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-8'),('MBP', 'Localization', 'IL-8')

Incubation with 2 microM MBP showed that, after a 1 h lag, the level of IL-8 release increased with time for approximately 10 h. At the 2 microM concentration, eosinophil cationic protein, eosinophil-derived neurotoxin, and eosinophil peroxidase did not stimulate significant levels of IL-8 production.
('MBP', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-8'),('MBP', 'Localization', 'IL-8')

MBP stimulated 2-fold increases in IL-8 messenger RNA (mRNA) after 1 and 3 h of incubation, which were blocked by pretreatment with actinomycin D. However, stimulation with MBP did not produce an increase in the binding activity of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB or activator protein-1.
('MBP', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-8'),('MBP', 'Localization', 'IL-8')

In addition, stimulation with MBP prolonged the stability of IL-8 mRNA.
('MBP', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-8'),('MBP', 'Localization', 'IL-8')

MBP also induced transient increases in mRNA for macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha and MIP-1beta, but did not stimulate the release of either chemokine.
('MBP', 'Localization', 'MIP-1beta'),('MBP', 'Localization', 'macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha')

These findings indicate that MBP is selective among the eosinophil granule proteins as a stimulus for neutrophil IL-8 release and, further, that stimulation of neutrophil IL-8 release by MBP involves both transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation.
('MBP', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-8'),('MBP', 'Localization', 'IL-8')

We postulate that MBP-induced release of IL-8 by neutrophils may contribute to the pathophysiology of acute asthma and other inflammatory lung diseases.

Tat enhances the NF-kappaB activity by hijacking IkappaB-alpha and inhibiting the post-activation turn off of NF-kappaB
('Tat', 'Binding', 'IkappaB-alpha')

Jurkat cells were transfected with siRNA Tat, siRNA control, or left untransfected, and 24 h later cells were infected with HXB2 Env-pseudotyped NL4-3.Luc.R-E- virions.
('siRNA Tat', 'Gene_expression', 'Tat')

The expression of Tat was detected at 1-h post-infection and progressively increased up to 12 h in untransfected and siRNA control-transfected cells, while it was barely detected in siRNA Tat-transfected cells (Figure 1A).
('siRNA Tat', 'Gene_expression', 'Tat')

The LTR-dependent luciferase expression was also progressively induced at 1- to 12-h post-infection in untransfected and siRNA control-transfected cells, while it was barely observed in siRNA Tat-transfected cells, as expected for the Tat-dependent transactivation of the HIV-1 LTR (Figure 1A).
('siRNA Tat', 'Gene_expression', 'Tat')

The progressive increase in NF-kappaB activity, as measured by p65-p50 binding to an NF-kappaB consensus oligonucleotide (Figure 1B) and nuclear p65 (Figure 1C, nucleus), was observed at 1- to 3-h post-infection in both Tat-positive (no siRNA or siRNA control) and Tat-negative (siRNA Tat) cells; however, at 12-h post-infection, the p65 DNA binding and nuclear p65 persisted elevated in presence of Tat (no siRNA and siRNA control), while they dropped in absence of Tat (siRNA Tat) (Figure 1B and C).
('Tat', 'Positive_regulation', 'p65'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65'),('Tat', 'Negative_regulation', 'p65'),('siRNA Tat', 'Gene_expression', 'Tat')

IkappaB-alpha was degraded in the cytosol within 3-h post-infection and de novo synthesized at 6 h with full replenishment at 12-h post-infection in both Tat-positive and Tat-negative cells (Figure 1C, cytosol).
('Tat', 'Binding', 'IkappaB-alpha')

These results indicated that in single-round HIV-1 infection the NF-kappaB activation initially correlated with the IKK activation and IkappaB-alpha degradation independently of the presence of Tat, and it was kept elevated in presence of Tat following the decay of the IKK activity and new synthesis of IkappaB-alpha.
('Tat', 'Binding', 'IkappaB-alpha')

In un-stimulated cells, the p65 DNA binding (Figure 2A) and nuclear p65 (Figure 2B, nucleus) were slightly enhanced by Tat, while the IkappaB-alpha content was not significantly affected (Figure 2B, cytosol).
('Tat', 'Positive_regulation', 'p65'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'IkappaB-alpha'),('Tat', 'Binding', 'p65'),('Tat', 'Negative_regulation', 'p65')

Transient stimulation with PMA increased the NF-kappaB DNA binding activity and nuclear p65 at 5 min peaking at 60-120 min independently of the presence of Tat (Figure 2A and B); however, while the p65 DNA binding and nuclear p65 persisted elevated at 240-min post-treatment in Tat-positive cells, they dropped in Tat-negative cells (Figure 2A and B).

Degradation of IkappaB-alpha was progressively induced at 5-30 min, followed by de novo synthesis at 60 min with full replenishment at 240 min in both Tat-positive and negative cells (Figure 2B, cytosol).
('Tat', 'Binding', 'IkappaB-alpha')

These results indicated that Tat enhanced the NF-kappaB activity in un-stimulated and PMA-stimulated cells without affecting the IKK activity and IkappaB-alpha content.
('Tat', 'Binding', 'IkappaB-alpha')

As we previously found that Tat binds to the sixth ankyrin of IkappaB-alpha (50,51), we tested whether Tat counteracted the generation of the IkappaB-alpha/NF-kappaB complex.
('Tat', 'Binding', 'IkappaB-alpha')

Coimmunoprecipitation of IkappaB-alpha with p65 was detected at 0- and 240-min post-treatment in Tat-negative cells (Figure 2D, lanes 1 and 3), and was halved in Tat-positive cells, where Tat coimmunoprecipitated with IkappaB-alpha (Figure 2D, lanes 2 and 4), indicating that Tat competed the IkappaB-alpha binding to p65.

To define the requirements of Foxp3 with respect to inhibition of NF-kappaB-dependent transcription, we utilized a mutant of Foxp3 lacking the FKH domain (Figure 2A) [16], similar to the scurfy mutant Foxp3 of mice, and a mutant Foxp3 protein from a patient with IPEX [4,11,14,17].
('Foxp3', 'Localization', 'Foxp3')

Although Foxp3 interaction with NF-kappaB presumably takes place in the nucleus, it may also be possible for a cytoplasmic Foxp3 protein to bind to NF-kappaB in the cytoplasm and prevent localization to the nucleus following an activation stimulus.
('Foxp3', 'Localization', 'Foxp3')

Western blot analysis of NF-kappaB p65 expression demonstrated that Foxp3 and DeltaFKH does not block NF-kappaB activation at the level of p65 protein expression (Figure 2E).
('DeltaFKH', 'Gene_expression', 'p65'),('Foxp3', 'Gene_expression', 'p65')

These results are very interesting with respect to Foxp3 function, because they suggest that the carboxyl-terminal FKH domain, and possibly nuclear localization, are dispensable for Foxp3 function in T cell populations.
('Foxp3', 'Localization', 'Foxp3')

CD28 costimulation augments IL-2 secretion of activated lamina propria T cells by increasing mRNA stability without enhancing IL-2 gene transactivation.
('CD28', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-2'),('IL-2', 'Localization', 'IL-2'),('CD28', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2'),('CD28', 'Localization', 'IL-2')

Coligation of CD28 leads to synergistic enhancement of IL-2 secretion.
('CD28', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-2'),('CD28', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2'),('CD28', 'Localization', 'IL-2')

Previous studies have characterized the CD28 augmentation of TCR-mediated signaling in peripheral blood T cells through transcriptional activation of an IL-2 promoter CD28 response element (CD28RE), along with enhanced mRNA stability.
('CD28', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-2'),('CD28', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2'),('CD28', 'Localization', 'IL-2')

This study characterized molecular events involved in CD28 costimulation of IL-2 production in LP mononuclear cells (LPMC).
('CD28', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-2'),('CD28', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2'),('CD28', 'Localization', 'IL-2')

LPMC exhibited increased IL-2 production in response to CD28 costimulation, compared with cells activated through CD2 alone.
('CD28', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-2'),('CD28', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2'),('CD28', 'Localization', 'IL-2')

IL-2 secretion was paralleled by increased expression of IL-2 mRNA, resulting from enhanced IL-2 mRNA stability.
('IL-2', 'Localization', 'IL-2')

In contrast to transcriptional activation in PBMC, EMSA revealed that CD28 coligation of CD2-activated LPMC does not result in increased binding of trans-factors to the CD28RE, nor did Western blots detect changes in I-kappaBalpha or I-kappaBbeta levels following CD28 coligation.
('CD28', 'Gene_expression', 'I-kappaBalpha'),('CD28', 'Gene_expression', 'I-kappaBbeta')

Furthermore, CD28 coligation fails to enhance IL-2 promoter-reporter or RE/AP construct expression in CD2-activated LPMC.
('CD28', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-2'),('CD28', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2'),('CD28', 'Localization', 'IL-2')

The results reported herein indicate that the molecular mechanisms involved in CD28 cosignaling and regulation of IL-2 secretion in LP T cells are unique to that compartment and differ from those seen in peripheral blood T cells.

Regulation of Id3 cell cycle function by Cdk-2-dependent phosphorylation.
('Cdk-2', 'Phosphorylation', 'Id3')

Recently, cyclin E-Cdk2- and cyclin A-Cdk2-dependent phosphorylation of a single conserved serine residue (Ser5) in Id2 has been shown to occur during late G1-to-S phase transition of the cell cycle, and this neutralizes the function of Id2 in abrogating E-box-dependent bHLH homo- or heterodimer complex formation in vitro (E.Hara, M.Hall, and G.Peters, EMBO J.16:332-342, 1997).
('cyclin E', 'Phosphorylation', 'Id2'),('cyclin A', 'Phosphorylation', 'Id2'),('Cdk2', 'Phosphorylation', 'Id2')

We now show that an analogous cell-cycle-regulated phosphorylation of Id3 alters the specificity of Id3 for abrogating both E-box-dependent bHLH homo- or heterodimer complex formation in vitro and E-box-dependent reporter gene function in vivo.
('Id3', 'Regulation', 'Id3')

Furthermore, compared with wild-type Id3, an Id3 Asp5 mutant (mimicking phosphorylation) is unable to promote cell cycle S phase entry in transfected fibroblasts, whereas an Id3 Ala5 mutant (ablating phosphorylation) displays an activity significantly greater than that of wild-type Id3 protein.
('Id3', 'Regulation', 'Id3')

The c-jun gene expression was very transient and was not detectable by 60 min after M-CSF addition.
('M-CSF', 'Gene_expression', 'c-jun')

Material immunoprecipitated with an isotype control antibody (isotype) or anti-CD40 antibody was examined by Western blotting for CD40, TRAF2, TRAF3, cIAP1, HOIP, IKKalpha/beta, and IKKgamma (right panels).
('HOIP', 'Binding', 'IKKgamma')

(C) To further evaluate HOIP-dependent recruitment of IKKgamma to CD40, A20.2J cells or HOIP-deficient (HOIP-/-) A20.2J cells were transduced with an empty retroviral vector or a retroviral construct encoding BP epitope-tagged IKKgamma (noted in the figure as pMIP and IKKgamma, respectively).

IL-10 Production by Th1 Cells Requires ERK1 and ERK2 Activation
('ERK2', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('ERK1', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10')

Our data showed that the maintenance of IL-10 induction in Th1 cells required stimulation with high antigen dose, which to some extent could be compensated for by the addition of IL-12.
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Although the apparent peak and amount of ERK1 and ERK2 activation varied slightly between experiments, a consistent finding was that high antigen dose differentiated Th1 cells always showed enhanced and prolonged ERK1 and ERK2 activation in the presence of IL-12, regardless of whether they were restimulated with high or low antigen dose (Figure5B).
('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'ERK1'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'ERK2')

We then investigated whether ERK1 and ERK2 activation was required for the induction of IL-10 in Th1 cells by using U0126 (Figure5C), a compound that blocks downstream ERK activation.
('ERK2', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('ERK1', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10')

As in the APC-driven cultures, stronger TCR stimulation together with IL-12 led to higher percentages of cells producing both IL-10 and IFN-gamma after 1 week of culture (Figure5C).
('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Because U0126 inhibits the MEK5-catalyzed activation of ERK5, as well as the MEK1- and MEK2-catalyzed activation of ERK1 and ERK2 (Bain etal., 2007; Mody etal., 2001), we also used the more specific, structurally unrelated MEK1 and MEK2 inhibitor PD184352 at concentrations in which it inhibits MEK1 and MEK2 but not MEK5 (Bain etal., 2007; Mody etal., 2001).
('MEK2', 'Positive_regulation', 'ERK1'),('MEK5', 'Positive_regulation', 'ERK5'),('MEK1', 'Positive_regulation', 'ERK2'),('MEK1', 'Positive_regulation', 'ERK1'),('MEK2', 'Positive_regulation', 'ERK2')

Upon addition of inhibitors to othersignaling pathways, including a p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB203580, or the GSK3beta inhibitor, CT99021 (Bain etal., 2007), no effect on IL-10 production was observed (FigureS5B).
('p38 MAPK', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('GSK3beta', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10')

Our data thus suggested that IL-10 production by Th1 cells in response to high antigen dose and IL-12 requires ERK1 and ERK2 signaling, but not the activation of the p38 or the GSK3beta pathways.
('ERK2', 'Positive_regulation', 'p38'),('ERK2', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10'),('ERK1', 'Positive_regulation', 'GSK3beta'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'ERK1'),('ERK2', 'Positive_regulation', 'GSK3beta'),('IL-12', 'Positive_regulation', 'ERK2'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('ERK1', 'Positive_regulation', 'p38'),('GSK3beta', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-10'),('ERK1', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-10')

We also found that the recruitment of HOIP to CD40 was TRAF2-dependent and that overexpression of a truncated HOIP mutant partially inhibited CD40-mediated NF-kappaB activation.
('TRAF2', 'Binding', 'HOIP')

A low amount of transcription of Ifngamma was induced by IL-12 when cells were differentiated with low antigen dose, but this effect of IL-12 was markedly upregulated with increasing doses of antigen (Figure6A).
('IL-12', 'Transcription', 'Ifngamma'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'Ifngamma')

However, IL-12 induced a high amount of Il10 transcription as well as Ifngamma expression with increased antigen doses (Figure6A), again in keeping with the protein data (Figure1A).
('IL-12', 'Transcription', 'Ifngamma'),('IL-12', 'Transcription', 'Il10'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'Ifngamma')

In contrast, high amounts of GATA-3 mRNA expression were only observed under Th2 cell differentiation conditions (low-dose antigen) (Figure6B), and this expression was markedly downregulated by both increasing antigen dose and coculture in IL-12 (Figure6B).
('IL-12', 'Transcription', 'GATA-3')

Interestingly, IL-12 sustained the high expression of c-Maf mRNA even at the highest antigen dose (Figure6B).
('IL-12', 'Transcription', 'c-Maf')

Moreover, IL-12 maintenance of c-maf expression required STAT4 activation (data not shown).
('c-maf', 'Positive_regulation', 'STAT4'),('IL-12', 'Gene_expression', 'c-maf')

We showed also that like Il10 expression, c-maf expression was inhibited in Th1 and Th17 cells in the presence of the MEK1 and MEK2 inhibitor (PD184352), whereas T-bet and RORgammat expression was hardly affected (Figure6D).

Wild-Type and LMP1 Transgenic Lymphoma Cells Do Not Require IL4 and Stat6 Signaling
('IL4', 'Phosphorylation', 'Stat6')

Activated Stat6 (pStat6), a target of the IL4 receptor pathway, was detected in the wild-type and LMP1 transgenic lymphocytes (Figure 4B).
('IL4', 'Phosphorylation', 'Stat6')

However, the pathway was not disabled, as treatment of the lymphoma cells with IL4 induced Stat6 phosphorylation (Figure 4C).
('IL4', 'Phosphorylation', 'Stat6')

In summary, the wild-type and LMP1 transgenic lymphoma cells grew independently of IL4 treatment and did not require Stat6 signaling.

GATA3 Is a Negative Regulator of FOXP3 Expression
('GATA3', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

FOXP3 expression decreased once GATA3 expression is high; therefore, we hypothesized a potential role for GATA3 in repressing FOXP3.
('GATA3', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

Besides GATA3's well-known positive effect on gene regulation, GATA3's repressive capabilities were previously shown to restrict Th1 commitment by inhibiting STAT4 expression [2,21], and therefore GATA3 prevents differentiation into Th1 cells.
('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'STAT4')

To investigate whether GATA3 can directly inhibit FOXP3 induction, we transduced GATA3 or a truncated GATA3 lacking the DNA-binding domain in human primary CD4+CD45RA+ T cells using a TAT-fused, recombinantly expressed GATA3.
('GATA3', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

TAT-GATA3 reduced FOXP3 expression in a dose-dependent manner, whereas a DNA-binding domain truncated version (TAT-DeltaDBD-GATA3) did not affect FOXP3 expression as compared with expression in untransduced cells (Figure 7A).
('GATA3', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('TAT-GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3')

In addition, we analyzed the inhibitory effect of GATA3 on FOXP3 in transgenic DO11.10 mice, constitutively overexpressing GATA3 under the control of the CD2 locus control region (DO11.10xCD2-GATA3).
('GATA3', 'Negative_regulation', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'FOXP3'),('GATA3', 'Positive_regulation', 'FOXP3')

To investigate the effect of GATA3 on iTreg, CD4+CD62L+CD25- cells were isolated, activated with OVA in the presence or absence of TGF-beta, and Foxp3 expression was analyzed after 4 d. The naive CD4+CD25- cells were Foxp3- (unpublished data).
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3'),('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3')

As described for the human cells, TGF-beta dramatically up-regulated Foxp3 in the DO11.10 littermate control mice.
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3')

In contrast, cells from the CD2-GATA3xDO11.10 mice showed dramatically reduced Foxp3 expression when activated with TGF-beta and OVA (Figure 7B).
('TGF-beta', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3'),('GATA3', 'Gene_expression', 'Foxp3')

In this study the effect of IL-10 on the expression of the protooncogene c-fos was investigated, because Fos plays a potential role in the regulation of B cell proliferation and differentiation.
('IL-10', 'Gene_expression', 'c-fos')

A significant 2-4 fold increase of c-fos expression was observed within 30 min of stimulation with IL-10 (p < 0.01).
('IL-10', 'Gene_expression', 'c-fos')

The IL-10 effect on c-fos expression was not blocked by polymyxin B.
('IL-10', 'Gene_expression', 'c-fos')

Using the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein (10 microM) a complete inhibition of IL-10 induced c-fos expression was observed.
('IL-10', 'Gene_expression', 'c-fos')

In addition, H-7 (10 microM), a specific inhibitor of serine/threonine kinases, significantly blocked IL-10 mediated c-fos expression (p < 0.05).
('IL-10', 'Gene_expression', 'c-fos')

In conclusion, these data show that IL-10 induces c-fos expression in human B-cells by activation of tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases.
('IL-10', 'Gene_expression', 'c-fos')

The interleukin 2 receptor alpha-chain (IL-2R alpha) gene is a key regulator of lymphocyte proliferation.
('IL-2', 'Transcription', 'IL-2R alpha')

IL-2R alpha is rapidly and potently induced in T cells in response to mitogenic stimuli.
('IL-2', 'Transcription', 'IL-2R alpha')

Interleukin 2 (IL-2) stimulates IL-2R alpha transcription, thereby amplifying expression of its own high-affinity receptor.
('IL-2', 'Transcription', 'IL-2R alpha')

IL-2R alpha transcription is at least in part controlled by two positive regulatory regions, PRRI and PRRII.
('IL-2', 'Transcription', 'IL-2R alpha')

However, none of these proximal regions account for the induction of IL-2R alpha transcription by IL-2.
('IL-2', 'Transcription', 'IL-2R alpha')

To find new regulatory regions of the IL-2R alpha gene, 8.5 kb of the 5' end noncoding sequence of the IL-2R alpha gene have been sequenced.
('IL-2', 'Transcription', 'IL-2R alpha')

To confirm the physiological relevance of these findings, we carried out in vivo footprinting experiments which showed that stimulation of IL-2R alpha expression correlated with occupancy of the GASd element.
('IL-2', 'Transcription', 'IL-2R alpha')

Our data demonstrate a major role of the GASd/EBSd element in IL-2R alpha regulation and suggest that the T-cell-specific Elf-1 factor can serve as a transcriptional repressor.
('IL-2', 'Transcription', 'IL-2R alpha')

Cotransfection of NF-kappa B (p50/p65)- or AP-1 (c-Jun/c-Fos)- expression vectors into Jurkat cells with a luciferase reporter containing the GM-CSF promoter did not stimulate transcription from the GM-CSF promoter.

Surprisingly, we find also that the interaction between SLP-76 and Vav is not required for their cooperation in augmenting IL-2 promoter activity, as the two molecules appear to function in different signaling pathways upstream of IL-2 gene expression.
('SLP-76', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-2'),('Vav', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2'),('SLP-76', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2')

Additionally, overexpression of Vav, but not SLP-76, augments CD28-induced IL-2 promoter activity.
('SLP-76', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-2'),('Vav', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2'),('SLP-76', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2')

These findings suggest that the synergy between SLP-76 and Vav in regulating IL-2 gene expression reflects the cooperation between different signaling pathways.

Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Tat upregulates interleukin-2 secretion in activated T cells.
('Tat', 'Localization', 'interleukin-2')

To investigate the effects of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Tat on interleukin-2 (IL-2) expression, we used IL-2 promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase constructs and IL-2-secreting Jurkat T cells as a model system.
('Tat', 'Transcription', 'IL-2'),('Tat', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2'),('Tat', 'Localization', 'interleukin-2')

Transient expression of HIV-1 Tat induced a five- to eightfold increase in IL-2 promoter activity in Jurkat T cells stimulated with phytohemagglutinin and phorbol myristate acetate.
('Tat', 'Transcription', 'IL-2'),('Tat', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2')

IL-2 secretion was increased more than twofold in both Jurkat T cells and primary T cells stimulated by extracellular HIV-1 Tat protein.
('Tat', 'Transcription', 'IL-2'),('Tat', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2')

Analysis of mRNA suggested that Tat exerts its effect on IL-2 primarily at the transcriptional level.
('Tat', 'Transcription', 'IL-2'),('Tat', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2')

The NF-kappa B site at positions -206 to -195 of the IL-2 promoter was required but not sufficient for the Tat effect.
('Tat', 'Transcription', 'IL-2'),('Tat', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-2')

The Tat-mediated increase in IL-2 promoter activity could selectively be blocked by antisense tat or-unlike the analogous effect of human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 Tax-by cyclosporin A.

Regulation of IL-6 synthesis in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells by C3a and C3a(desArg).

In this study we investigated the effects of C3a and C3a(desArg) on gene expression and protein secretion of IL-6 in human PBMCs, either alone or in combination with LPS or IL-1beta.
('C3a(desArg)', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-6'),('C3a', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-6'),('IL-1beta', 'Localization', 'IL-6'),('C3a', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-6'),('IL-1beta', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-6'),('C3a', 'Localization', 'IL-6'),('C3a(desArg)', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-6'),('C3a(desArg)', 'Localization', 'IL-6')

C3a or C3a(desArg) alone exhibited no effect on the expression or secretion of IL-6.

However, when PBMC were stimulated with LPS or IL-1beta, both C3a and C3a(desArg) were found to enhance IL-6 release by PBMC in a dose-dependent manner.
('C3a(desArg)', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-6'),('C3a', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-6'),('IL-1beta', 'Localization', 'IL-6'),('C3a', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-6'),('IL-1beta', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-6'),('C3a', 'Localization', 'IL-6'),('C3a(desArg)', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-6'),('C3a(desArg)', 'Localization', 'IL-6')

Since C3a has been shown to induce PGE2 production by monocytes, and PGE2 has been shown to influence cytokine production, we investigated the potential role of PGE2 in C3a-mediated enhancement of LPS- and IL-1beta-induced IL-6 production.
('C3a', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-6'),('IL-1beta', 'Localization', 'IL-6'),('C3a', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-6'),('IL-1beta', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-6'),('C3a', 'Localization', 'IL-6')

Indomethacin blocked PGE2 release, but had no influence on the observed effects of C3a, suggesting that the effects of C3a on IL-6 production are independent of PGE2 formation by monocytes.
('C3a', 'Positive_regulation', 'IL-6'),('C3a', 'Gene_expression', 'IL-6'),('C3a', 'Localization', 'IL-6')

p21ras initiates Rac-1 but not phosphatidyl inositol 3 kinase/PKB, mediated signaling pathways in T lymphocytes.

In contrast, p21ras signals are unable to induce Akt/PKB activity in T cell nor is Ras function required for Akt/PKB activation in response to the TCR.

Whereas different anti-CD4 mAb or HIV-1 gp120 could all trigger activation of the protein tyrosine kinases p56lck and p59fyn and phosphorylation of the Shc adaptor protein, which mediates signals to Ras, they differed significantly in their ability to activate NF-AT.
