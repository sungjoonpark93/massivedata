We investigated previoulsy described and newly discovered transcription factor binding sites of the IL-1RA promoter (Table 1) using the program OMIGA (v.1.1.3, Oxford Molecular, Oxford, UK). The LPS responsive kappaB consensus site of LRE-1 (between -84 and -93) [30] displayed band shifts, but no significant alterations of its binding activity, irrespective of the treatment (data not shown). A new kappaB3 site (-100 and -130) within the LRE-1 [30] showed increased binding induced by TSST-1 (+30% vs. control), but GP co-treatment up-regulated the LPS (+65% vs. control)- and the TSST-1 (+110% vs. control)-induced binding in a superadditive synergistic fashion, when compared to medium control as well as to LPS, TSST-1 or GP or the theoretical values of GP/LPS calc. or GP/TSST-1 calc. (all p < 0.05; Fig. 4). Binding to a new kappaB consensus site (between -266 and -280) was significantly elevated for GP + TSST-1 (p < 0.05; data not shown). The LPS-, TSST-1- and GP + LPS-induced binding to the new kappaB2/3 site (-288 and -302) was down-regulated by about 20-35% in comparison with medium control (p < 0.05; data not shown). The NFIL-6 site (-147 and -170) close to LRE-2 [31,32] showed an up-regulation of binding for all compounds and combinations vs. medium control, ranging from 25-110% (p < 0.05). Further, GP + TSST-1 induced an increased binding to the NFIL-6 site in comparison with TSST-1 (1.3fold) or GP (1.6fold; p < 0.05), (data not shown). A new binding site for NFATP2/3 was found more distal of the transcription start site, between -471 and -490, displaying again a substantial increase of binding for all compounds and combinations, when compared to medium control (p < 0.05). In addition, binding to the NFATP2/3 site following both, GP + LPS (1.4fold of GP) and GP + TSST-1 (1.5fold of GP, 1.25fold of TSST-1) was elevated (p < 0.05; Fig. 5), but only in an additive synergistic manner, i.e. the experimental results were not different from the theoretical values (calc.).","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":18,"end":24},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":29,"end":33},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":51,"end":57},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":84,"end":90},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":99,"end":105},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":205,"end":213},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":215,"end":219},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":223,"end":231},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":317,"end":323},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":434,"end":440},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":822,"end":828},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":918,"end":924},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1052,"end":1058},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1113,"end":1119},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1249,"end":1255},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1294,"end":1300},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1662,"end":1668},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1736,"end":1742},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":2131,"end":2137},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":2166,"end":2172},"category":"Protein"}]}
