The Sox6 in vitro translation expression vector, tagged with c-Myc and HA, was described before [15]. The translation was performed in a reticulocyte lysate based in vitro translational system (TNT(R) Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation Systems, Promega). A vector without the Sox6 coding sequence was also translated as a negative control.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":52,"end":56},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":183,"end":187},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":240,"end":245},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":250,"end":252},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":460,"end":464},"category":"Protein"}]}
