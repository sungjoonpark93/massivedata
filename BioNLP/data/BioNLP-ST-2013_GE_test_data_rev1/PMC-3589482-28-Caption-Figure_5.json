(B) Cold competition EMSAs performed with the radiolabelled murine SerpinB2 promoter -212/-185 probe and a 100-fold molar excess of each of the double stranded oligonucleotides described in (A) demonstrate the specificity of the DNA-protein complexes. (C) Supershift assays were performed with the -212/-185 probe by after preincubation with the indicated specific C/EBP antibody. The LPS-inducible complex is indicated with an arrowhead.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":52,"end":60},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":99,"end":109},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":239,"end":247},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":295,"end":303},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":364,"end":371},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":403,"end":410},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":492,"end":500},"category":"Protein"}]}
