In brief, a 96-well plate (Nunc) was coated with 4 mug/ml monoclonal antibodies against IL-17 (R & D Systems) at 4degreesC overnight. After blocking with phosphate-buffered saline/1% bovine serum albumin (BSA)/0.05% Tween 20 for 2 hours at room temperature (22-25degreesC), test samples and the standard recombinant IL-17 (R & D Systems) were added to the 96-well plate and incubated at room temperature for 2 hours. Plates were washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline/Tween 20, and then incubated with 500 ng/ml biotinylated mouse monoclonal antibodies against IL-17 (R & D Systems) for 2 hours at room temperature. After washing, streptavidin-alkaline phosphate-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Sigma) was incubated for 2 hours, then washed again and incubated with 1 mg/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma) dissolved in diethanolamine (Sigma) to develop the color reaction. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 M NaOH and the optical density of each well was read at 405 nm. The lower limit of IL-17 detection was 10 pg/ml. Recombinant human IL-17 diluted in culture medium was used as a calibration standard, ranging from 10 to 2000 pg/ml. A standard curve was drawn by plotting optical density against the log of the concentration of recombinant cytokines, and used for determination of IL-17 in test samples.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":37,"end":42},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":43,"end":48},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":250,"end":255},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":478,"end":483},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":733,"end":738},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":1176,"end":1181},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":1224,"end":1229},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":1471,"end":1476},"category":"Protein"}]}
