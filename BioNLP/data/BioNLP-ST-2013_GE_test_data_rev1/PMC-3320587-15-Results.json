We examined the requirement of NFAT5 for MTb-induced LTR activity by transfecting a wild-type and NFAT5 mutant LTR reporter construct into THP-1 cells, followed by stimulation with an MTb lysate. As shown in Figure 1B, in the absence of MTb lysate stimulation the activity of the NFAT5 binding site-mutant LTR was significantly reduced (p<0.05) in comparison to the wild-type LTR. When the NFAT5 binding site-mutant LTR was examined in THP-1 cells stimulated with the MTb lysate, its activity was reduced to an even more significant extent (p<0.01).\nTo determine whether MTb lysate stimulation directly enhances NFAT5 expression in THP-1 cells, we stimulated cells for 8 or 24 hours or left them unstimulated and examined NFAT5 protein levels by western blot. As shown in Figure 1C, we found that NFAT5 protein levels steadily increased in response to MTb lysate stimulation, revealing that TLR engagement by MTb results in enhanced levels of NFAT5, consistent with its playing a role in MTb-induced activation of the HIV-1 LTR.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":23,"end":28},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":150,"end":155},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":389,"end":394},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":496,"end":501},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":1077,"end":1082},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":1187,"end":1192},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":1262,"end":1267},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":1408,"end":1413},"category":"Protein"}]}
