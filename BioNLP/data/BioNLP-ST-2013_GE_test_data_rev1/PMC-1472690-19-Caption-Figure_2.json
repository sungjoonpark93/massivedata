In order to determine whether the DNA binding proteins activated by GP were related to NFkappaB and NFAT, an immuno(dot) blot was performed. A representative dot blot showing staining of negative and positive controls (recombinant proteins NFkappaB p52, c-rel; nuclear extracts of PMA-treated Jurkat cells positive for NFkappaB p50, p65 and for NFATc1, c2) in the upper panel and staining of nuclear extracts of GP-treated PBMC (positive for NFkappaB p65, p50 and NFAT c2, c1) in the lower panel is shown (n = 3).","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":9,"end":12},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":13,"end":16},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":21,"end":27},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":28,"end":30},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":172,"end":176},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":321,"end":324},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":326,"end":331},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":400,"end":403},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":405,"end":408},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":417,"end":423},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":425,"end":427},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":523,"end":526},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":528,"end":531},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":536,"end":543},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":545,"end":547},"category":"Protein"}]}
