{"source_db":"PMC","source_id":"1064895","division_id":20,"section":"Conclusions","text":"We have detected a more pronounced production of IL-17 from RA PBMC in response to IL-15 and MCP-1 as well as stimulation by anti-CD3/anti-CD28. We have also shown that upregulation of IL-17 by activated T cells in patients with RA could be the result of activation via the PI3K/Akt pathway with resultant NF-kappaB activation. Our data provide insights into cellular mechanisms of the regulation of IL-17 production in RA, and highlight the role of T cells, which has hitherto been neglected in RA pathogenesis. Together with recent data on the successful introduction of anti-IL-17 in RA, our results have added information for the future molecular targeting of new therapeutic applications in RA.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":49,"end":54},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":83,"end":88},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":93,"end":98},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":139,"end":143},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":185,"end":190},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":279,"end":282},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":400,"end":405},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":578,"end":583},"category":"Protein"}]}
