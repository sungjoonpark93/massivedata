Primers were designed with PerlPrimer (http://perlprimer.sourceforge.net). Quantification was performed using the comparative CT method (deltadeltaCT). Results are expressed relative to HPRT values.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":428,"end":432},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":500,"end":507},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":572,"end":575},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":638,"end":642},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":709,"end":714},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":778,"end":787},"category":"Protein"}]}
