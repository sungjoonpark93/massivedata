Mouse and human nucleotide sequences were aligned using Clustal W software. Cis-acting elements conserved between the human and murine SerpinB2 promoters are boxed and labeled. AP-1 =  activator protein 1; C/EBP =  CCAAT enhancer binding protein; CRE = cAMP response element; Oct1 =  octamer transcription factor 1/POU2F1; PU.1 =  purine box binding protein 1. The putative transcription initiation site (tis) is indicated and exon 1 is presented in uppercase. The location of the 5' ends of the -539, -189 and -87 reporter constructs are also shown.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":84,"end":92},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":246,"end":254},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":387,"end":391},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":395,"end":425},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":426,"end":432},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":434,"end":438},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":442,"end":470},"category":"Protein"}]}
