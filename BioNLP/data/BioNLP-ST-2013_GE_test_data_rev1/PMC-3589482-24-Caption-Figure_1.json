(A) qPCR analysis of murine SerpinB2 mRNA levels, relative to beta-actin. The plot is representative of at least two independent experiments performed in triplicate. (B) Immunoblot analysis of SerpinB2 protein expression in whole cell lysates. Blot was reprobed for GAPDH as a loading control.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":17,"end":25},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":188,"end":196},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":222,"end":232},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":353,"end":361},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":426,"end":431},"category":"Protein"}]}
