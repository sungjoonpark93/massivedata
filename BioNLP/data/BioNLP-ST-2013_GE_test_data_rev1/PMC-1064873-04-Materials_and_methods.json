The cells were incubated with 1 mug/ml anti-CD28 mAb (Immunotech) in the presence or absence of the indicated concentrations of IL-10 (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA, USA) at 37degreesC in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 [28]. Culture supernatants were collected 36 hours later and cell-free samples were stored at -30degreesC until cytokine assay.\nTo examine the effect of IL-6 on T-cell responsiveness to IL-10, CD4+ T cells from healthy controls were incubated in culture medium with 10% FCS in the presence or absence of 10 ng/ml IL-6 (Becton Dickinson) for 36 hours. Cells were then stimulated for 36 hours with anti-CD3 mAb and anti-CD28 mAb in the presence or absence of 1 ng/ml IL-10. Culture supernatants were measured for IFN-gamma concentrations.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":11,"end":14},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":27,"end":30},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":340,"end":344},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":424,"end":429},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":680,"end":684},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":713,"end":718},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":720,"end":723},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":840,"end":844},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":945,"end":949},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":992,"end":997},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1038,"end":1047},"category":"Protein"}]}
