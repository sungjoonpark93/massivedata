To investigate C/EBP-beta phosphorylation sites that may be important for LPS-stimulated SerpinB2 proximal promoter activity (Fig. 8B), we co-expressed several C/EBP-beta phospho-acceptor mutants in which the critical threonine or serine residue was mutated to an alanine, along with the pGLmP-539 murine SerpinB2 luciferase reporter in Cebpb-/- MEFs. Re-expression of wild-type C/EBP-beta in Cebpb-/- MEFs significantly stimulated SerpinB2 luciferase reporter gene expression in the presence of LPS by ~3 fold (Fig. 8C, left), confirming the importance of C/EBP-beta to LPS-induced SerpinB2 gene transcription. Expression of the C/EBP-beta phospho-acceptor mutant, C/EBPbetaT217A, in Cebpb-/- MEFs did not significantly increase SerpinB2 promoter activity above that of wild-type C/EBP-beta (Fig. 8C, right); confirming that phosphorylation of C/EBP-beta at T217 is not a major factor in the regulation of SerpinB2 promoter activity in response to LPS.\nC/EBP-beta contains additional phosphorylation sites, C/EBP-betaT188 and C/EBP-betaS64 (Fig. 8B), which may be involved in modulating C/EBP-beta-dependent SerpinB2 gene transcription. C/EBP-betaT188 is implicated in regulating DAPK1, an IFNgamma-inducible gene involved in the regulation of cell cycle and apoptosis [38], processes with which SerpinB2 has also been associated [17]. C/EBP-betaS64 is important for LPS-induced transcription of the cytokines IL-6 and MCP-1 [64]. Similarly, SerpinB2 is induced by LPS and regulated in a manner similar to cytokines [29]. Given the similarities in the functional significance of these phospho-specific isoforms of C/EBP-beta and SerpinB2, we investigated whether these phospho-acceptor sites may play a role in SerpinB2 gene expression. C/EBP-betaT188A-transfected MEFs exhibited SerpinB2 promoter activity similar to that of wild-type C/EBP-beta-transfected MEFs, whereas the expression of C/EBP-betaS64A potentiated SerpinB2 promoter activity in response to LPS (Fig. 8C, right). These data suggest that phosphorylation of C/EBP-beta at S64 acts to negatively regulate SerpinB2 proximal promoter activity.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":19,"end":29},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":79,"end":87},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":125,"end":135},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":218,"end":228},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":292,"end":300},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":363,"end":398},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":508,"end":536},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":540,"end":545},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":582,"end":592},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":596,"end":601},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":635,"end":663},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":760,"end":770},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":786,"end":794},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":833,"end":867},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":869,"end":883},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":888,"end":893},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":933,"end":941},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":984,"end":994},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1048,"end":1058},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1110,"end":1118},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":1157,"end":1167},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":1291,"end":1301},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":1312,"end":1320},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":1384,"end":1389},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":1394,"end":1402},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":1413,"end":1417},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":1500,"end":1508},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":1614,"end":1618},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":1623,"end":1628},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":1646,"end":1654},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T31","span":{"begin":1818,"end":1828},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T32","span":{"begin":1833,"end":1841},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T33","span":{"begin":1915,"end":1923},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T34","span":{"begin":1941,"end":1956},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T35","span":{"begin":1984,"end":1992},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T36","span":{"begin":2040,"end":2050},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T37","span":{"begin":2095,"end":2109},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T38","span":{"begin":2122,"end":2130},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T39","span":{"begin":2229,"end":2239},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T40","span":{"begin":2275,"end":2283},"category":"Protein"}]}
