NF-kappaB and NFAT5 binding site mutations were introduced into the LTR of the HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-wild type (WT) infectious molecular clone. The NF-kappaB binding site mutants (HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-kappaB I-Mut, HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-kappaB II-Mut, HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-kappaB I+II-Mut), and NFAT5 binding site mutant (HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-N5-Mut) are shown along with the HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-WT sequence. Mutations were introduced into the 3' LTR of the HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-WT proviral sequence. (B) Specific mutation of the NFAT5 binding site abolishes NFAT5 binding to the viral LTR but does not affect NF-kappaB p50/p65 binding to the overlapping NF-kappaB binding site. Quantitative DNaseI footprinting analysis is shown using HIV-1 LTR fragments (-262 to +4 nt relative to the transcription start site) from HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-WT and HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-N5-Mut and increasing concentrations of recombinant NF-kappaB (p50/p65) (25 ng, 100 ng, and 500 ng), or NFAT5 (10 ng, 50 ng, and 250 ng). The regions that are protected from DNase I cleavage by the binding of NF-kappaB and NFAT5 are indicated with a bars. (C) Specific disruption of the HIV-1 subtype B NF-kappaB binding sites effectively abrogates recombinant p50/p65 binding. Quantitative DNaseI footprinting analysis is shown of nucleotides -262 to +4 from HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-WT, HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-kappaB I-Mut, HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-kappaB II-Mut, and HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-kappaB I+II-Mut and increasing concentrations of recombinant NF-kappaB (p50/p65) (25 ng, 100 ng, and 500 ng). The regions that are protected from DNase I cleavage by the binding of recombinant NF-kappaB are indicated with a bars. (D) Specific disruption of the HIV-1 subtype B NF-kappaB binding site does not inhibit but enhances NFAT5 binding to this region. Quantitative DNaseI footprinting analysis is shown of nucleotides -262 to +4 from HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-WT, HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-kappaB I-Mut, HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-kappaB II-Mut, and HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-kappaB I+II-Mut and increasing concentrations of recombinant NFAT5 (10 ng, 50 ng, and 250 ng). The regions that are protected from DNase I cleavage by the binding of recombinant NFAT5 are indicated with a bars.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":132,"end":135},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":256,"end":259},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":352,"end":355},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":383,"end":386},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":415,"end":418},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":481,"end":484},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":531,"end":534},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":610,"end":613},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":694,"end":699},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":755,"end":758},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":759,"end":762},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":827,"end":833},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":966,"end":969},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":990,"end":993},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1057,"end":1060},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1061,"end":1064},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1098,"end":1103},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1168,"end":1175},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1217,"end":1222},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1355,"end":1358},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":1359,"end":1362},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":1385,"end":1391},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":1467,"end":1470},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":1488,"end":1491},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":1519,"end":1522},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":1555,"end":1558},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":1631,"end":1634},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":1635,"end":1638},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":1705,"end":1712},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":1889,"end":1894},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T31","span":{"begin":1932,"end":1938},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T32","span":{"begin":2014,"end":2017},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T33","span":{"begin":2035,"end":2038},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T34","span":{"begin":2066,"end":2069},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T35","span":{"begin":2102,"end":2105},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T36","span":{"begin":2167,"end":2172},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T37","span":{"begin":2237,"end":2244},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T38","span":{"begin":2284,"end":2289},"category":"Protein"}]}
