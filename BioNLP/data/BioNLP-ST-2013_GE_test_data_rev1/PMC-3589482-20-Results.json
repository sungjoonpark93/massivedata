RAW 264.7 cells were stimulated with LPS for up to 8 hrs, soluble chromatin was immunoprecipitated with antibodies against DNA binding proteins, and the enriched DNA amplified by both semi-quantitative and qPCR using SerpinB2 proximal promoter specific primers (illustrated in fig. 4A). The results showed that C/EBP-beta is constitutively present at the SerpinB2 promoter as demonstrated by its association with the promoter in unstimulated macrophages and increased temporally in response to LPS reaching as much as 10-fold over unstimulated cells after 8 hrs (Fig. 7). Since changes in C/EBP-beta phosphorylation states can affect C/EBP-beta's ability to transactivate target genes [38]; [63]; [64], we investigated recruitment to the SerpinB2 proximal promoter of the T217 phosphorylated C/EBP-beta isoform (p-C/EBP-betaT217), which has been associated with cell survival [65]. p-C/EBP-betaT217 was constitutively bound to the SerpinB2 proximal promoter and also present after 1 hr of LPS stimulation (Fig. 7). In contrast to total C/EBP-beta, the binding affinity of p-C/EBP-betaT217 for the SerpinB2 proximal promoter diminished with LPS stimulation at later timepoints (4 and 8 hrs)(Fig. 7). These data show an inverse relationship between C/EBP-beta and p-C/EBP-betaT217 recruitment, and indicate that T217-phosphorylated C/EBP-beta may not be responsible for increased transcription from the SerpinB2 promoter in response to LPS.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":10},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":28,"end":36},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":131,"end":141},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":168,"end":176},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":471,"end":479},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":565,"end":575},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":609,"end":617},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":843,"end":853},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":888,"end":898},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":992,"end":1000},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1046,"end":1056},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1066,"end":1082},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1136,"end":1152},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1185,"end":1193},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1290,"end":1300},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1326,"end":1342},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1351,"end":1359},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1501,"end":1511},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1516,"end":1532},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1584,"end":1594},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":1655,"end":1663},"category":"Protein"}]}
