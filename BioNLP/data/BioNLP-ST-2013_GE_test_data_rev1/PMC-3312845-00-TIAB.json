To elucidate the mechanism of SE-induced vasogenic edema, we investigated the roles of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption during vasogenic edema and its related events in rat epilepsy models provoked by pilocarpine-induced SE.\nMethods\nSE was induced by pilocarpine in rats that were intracerebroventricularly infused with saline-, and soluble TNF p55 receptor (sTNFp55R) prior to SE induction. Thereafter, we performed Fluoro-Jade B staining and immunohistochemical studies for TNF-alpha and NF-kappaB subunits.\nResults\nFollowing SE, most activated microglia showed strong TNF-alpha immunoreactivity. In addition, TNF p75 receptor expression was detected in endothelial cells as well as astrocytes. In addition, only p65-Thr435 phosphorylation was increased in endothelial cells accompanied by SMI-71 expression (an endothelial barrier antigen). Neutralization of TNF-alpha by soluble TNF p55 receptor (sTNFp55R) infusion attenuated SE-induced vasogenic edema and neuronal damages via inhibition of p65-Thr435 phosphorylation in endothelial cells. Furthermore, sTNFp55R infusion reduced SE-induced neutrophil infiltration in the PC.\nConclusion\nThese findings suggest that impairments of endothelial cell functions via TNF-alpha-mediated p65-Thr 485 NF-kappaB phosphorylation may be involved in SE-induced vasogenic edema. Subsequently, vasogenic edema results in extensive neutrophil infiltration and neuronal-astroglial loss.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":27},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":70,"end":73},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":462,"end":495},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":757,"end":773},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":776,"end":783},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":892,"end":901},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":987,"end":996},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":1028,"end":1044},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1131,"end":1134},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1278,"end":1287},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1299,"end":1315},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1318,"end":1325},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1413,"end":1416},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1476,"end":1483},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1632,"end":1641},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1651,"end":1654},"category":"Protein"}]}
