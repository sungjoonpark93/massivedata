Macrophage-specific STAT3-deficient mice demonstrated that STAT3 plays a dominant role in IL-10-mediated anti-inflammatory responses [5], which has recently been confirmed in human macrophages by studies of dominant-negative STAT3 overexpression [30]. The induction of STAT1 and STAT3 phosphorylation by IL-10 in PB CD4+ T cells from active RA patients and from healthy controls was examined using western blotting. STAT3 phosphorylation was dose-dependently induced after IL-10 activation for 20 min in normal CD4+ T cells (Fig. 4a,4b). In contrast, STAT3 was phosphorylated in freshly isolated PB CD4+ cells from RA patients and this STAT3 phosphorylation was detectable for up to 6 hours. STAT3 phosphorylation was augmented only when activated by as much as 10 ng/ml IL-10. Both sustained STAT3 phosphorylation and defective IL-10-induced STAT3 phosphorylation were found in RA ST CD4+ T cells (Fig. 4c). On the other hand, IL-10-induced STAT1 phosphorylation was not detected in either RA CD4+ T cells or normal CD4+ T cells (Fig. 4a). These results indicate that STAT3 is the major IL-10-activated STAT in CD4+ T cells, and IL-10-induced STAT3 activation may be diminished in active RA, in association with sustained STAT3 phosphorylation.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":10,"end":15},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":25,"end":30},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":53,"end":56},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":85,"end":91},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":97,"end":102},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":187,"end":192},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":197,"end":202},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":228,"end":233},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":267,"end":272},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":298,"end":303},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":433,"end":438},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":477,"end":482},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":487,"end":492},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":512,"end":517},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":524,"end":527},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":624,"end":629},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":681,"end":686},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":719,"end":722},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":759,"end":764},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":807,"end":810},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":844,"end":849},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":900,"end":905},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":979,"end":984},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":1001,"end":1006},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":1037,"end":1042},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":1051,"end":1056},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":1093,"end":1096},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":1136,"end":1141},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":1150,"end":1155},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":1202,"end":1205},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T31","span":{"begin":1225,"end":1228},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T32","span":{"begin":1277,"end":1282},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T33","span":{"begin":1296,"end":1301},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T34","span":{"begin":1320,"end":1323},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T35","span":{"begin":1338,"end":1343},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T36","span":{"begin":1352,"end":1357},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T37","span":{"begin":1431,"end":1436},"category":"Protein"}]}
