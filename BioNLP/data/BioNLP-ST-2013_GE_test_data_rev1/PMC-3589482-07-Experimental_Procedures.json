Transfected cells were transferred to 10 ml of pre-warmed media in 6-well tissue culture plates, divided into two identical cell pools and incubated 16 hrs in a 5% CO2 and 95% humidified air atmosphere at 37degreesC either in the presence or absence of 100 ng/ml LPS. Luciferase activity was measured using a Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System kit (Promega). Measurements represent the results of at least three independent experiments. Promoter activity is expressed as the number of firefly luciferase light units normalized either to pRL-TK renilla luciferase light units or to cellular protein concentration (where co-transfected C/EBP-beta or LPS affected pRL-TK activity). Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein microassay reagent.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":27,"end":37},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":149,"end":159},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":208,"end":224},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":226,"end":228},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":848,"end":858},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":894,"end":904},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":1076,"end":1086},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":1124,"end":1126},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1135,"end":1145},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1217,"end":1227},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1248,"end":1250},"category":"Protein"}]}
