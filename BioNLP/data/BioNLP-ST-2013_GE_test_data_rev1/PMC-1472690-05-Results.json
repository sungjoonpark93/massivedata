Therefore, we applied the IL-1beta/IL-1RA ratio as an indicator of the degree of inflammation. Both, LPS and GP + LPS treatments resulted in generating more IL-1beta than IL-1RA at early time points, i.e. up to 24 h. Comparing LPS vs. GP + LPS, we did not find substantial alterations over a time course of 48 h in the IL-1beta/IL-1RA ratio, only a - non-significant - 2.5fold higher ratio at 6 h. With respect to TSST-1 or the theoretical value of GP/TSST-1 calc. vs. GP + TSST-1, we observed a pronounced anti-inflammatory action of GP, as demonstrated by an about 10-100 fold reduced ratio at 18 h and 24 h of incubation, i.e. a higher production of IL-1RA than of IL-1beta (n = 3; both p < 0.05; Fig. 6). A biological relevance of this result was suggested by a decrease of the IL-1 dependent release of IL-2 from murine EL-4 cells following GP + TSST-1 when compared to TSST-1 or GP/TSST-1 calc. (data not shown in detail, n = 4; p < 0.07).","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":17,"end":23},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":32,"end":40},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":41,"end":47},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":119,"end":127},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":132,"end":138},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":241,"end":249},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":250,"end":256},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":372,"end":380},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":386,"end":392},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":534,"end":542},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":543,"end":549},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":629,"end":635},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":667,"end":673},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":689,"end":695},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":868,"end":874},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":883,"end":891},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":997,"end":1001},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1023,"end":1027},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1066,"end":1072},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1090,"end":1096},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":1103,"end":1109},"category":"Protein"}]}
