Toll-like receptor 4- (TLR4-) mediated nuclear factor kappa-B (NFkappaB) signaling plays critical roles in the activation and regulation of inflammatory responses in injured brain. However, the involvement of TLR4-mediated NFkappaB signaling in the pathogenesis of ICH remains unknown. The present study was to evaluate the temporal profile of the expression of TLR4 and the activation of TLR4-mediated NFkappaB signaling in brain tissues of Wistar rats after ICH. TLR4 mRNA and protein, the phosphorylation of inhibitors of kappa B (p-IkappaBalpha), and the activity of NFkappaB were examined in hemorrhagic cerebral tissue by Rt-PCR, Western blots, immunohistochemistry staining, and EMSA. Compared with saline control, the TLR4 mRNA and protein significantly increased starting at 6 hours after ICH, peaked on the 3rd day after ICH, and then decreased but still maintained at a higher level on the 7th day after ICH (P < .05). The level of p-IkappaBalpha and the activity of NFkappaB also increased in the brain after ICH compared with saline control. The present study firstly suggests that TLR4-mediated NFkappaB signaling participates in the pathogenesis of ICH, which may become a therapeutic target for ICH-induced brain damage.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":14,"end":18},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":177,"end":197},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":200,"end":204},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":386,"end":390},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":539,"end":543},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":566,"end":570},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":642,"end":646},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":688,"end":709},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":713,"end":725},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":903,"end":907},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1122,"end":1134},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1272,"end":1276},"category":"Protein"}]}
