(A) Neutrophil infiltration in vasogenic edema lesion 1 day after SE. (B) MIP-2 expression in the PC 1 day after SE. (C) Astroglial expression of MIP-2 (arrows). Bars = 12.5 (A and C) and 150 (B) mum. (D) Quantitative analysis of neutrophil infiltration 1 day after SE (mean +/- S.E.M). Significant differences from saline-infused animals, *p < 0.05. (E) Linear regression analysis between the number of infiltrated neutrophils/area in the vasogenic edema region and the area of vasogenic edema in the PC. (F) Quantitative analysis of the number of MIP-2 positive cells per the unit area of vasogenic edema 1 day after SE (mean +/- S.E.M). There is no difference in the number of MIP-2-positive cells per unit area of vasogenic edema between sTNFp55R-infused animals and saline-infused animals. (G) Linear regression analysis between the number of MIP-2 positive cells per unit area in vasogenic edema region and the area of vasogenic edema in the PC.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":11,"end":18},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":59,"end":64},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":164,"end":169},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":236,"end":241},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":639,"end":644},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":770,"end":775},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":833,"end":840},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":938,"end":943},"category":"Protein"}]}
