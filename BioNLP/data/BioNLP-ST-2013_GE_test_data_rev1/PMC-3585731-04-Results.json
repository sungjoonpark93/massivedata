Furthermore, addition of TNFalpha led to comparable late activation of Akt p308 signal under both normal and serum free conditions (Fig. S4B, C), indicating that TNFalpha signaling to Akt Thr308 is growth factor-independent. In contrast, activation of JNK by TNFalpha followed different kinetics from zVAD.fmk-induced changes. TNFalpha treatment caused an early and robust increase in the phosphorylation of JNK and c-Jun. Nec-1 did not affect this early increase, however, it reduced levels of pJNK/Jun at the late, 9 hr time point (Fig. S4B, C). This again separated early RIP1-independent changes, which likely reflect the ability of additional upstream kinases, such as Ask1 to activate JNK [27], from the late RIP1 kinase-dependent necroptotic signaling.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":8},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":125,"end":133},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":232,"end":240},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":392,"end":400},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":529,"end":537},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":626,"end":634},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":694,"end":702},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":783,"end":788},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":942,"end":946},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1041,"end":1045},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1082,"end":1086},"category":"Protein"}]}
