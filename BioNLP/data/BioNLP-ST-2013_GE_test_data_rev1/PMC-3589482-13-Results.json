A similar strong induction of LPS-inducible SerpinB2 mRNA expression has been reported previously in murine peritoneal macrophages and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells [4]; [32]. LPS-induced SerpinB2 expression involves both an increase in gene transcription and stabilization of the mRNA [5]; [29]; [42]-[44]. SerpinB2 protein expression was also induced as has been reported in other cell types [31], and detectable after 8 hrs of LPS treatment (Fig. 1).","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":4,"end":12},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":93,"end":101},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":255,"end":263},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":410,"end":418},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":530,"end":538},"category":"Protein"}]}
