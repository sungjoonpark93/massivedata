Correlation coefficients and corresponding significances were analyzed by the Pearson test (normal distribution) or the Spearman test (non-normal distribution). To compare experimental data to a theoretical value (for example GP + TSST-1 vs GP/TSST-1 calc.) we calculated the sum of the individual effects and added these values into Fig. 1B, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Significances of differences between experimental data (for example GP vs LPS) as well as between experimental data and theoretical values (for example GP + TSST-1 vs GP/TSST-1 calc.) were analysed using the Student's t-test (normal distribution) or the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test (non-normal distribution), (SPSS for Windows; SPSS Science Software, Erkrath, Germany).","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":402,"end":408},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":415,"end":421},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":687,"end":693},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":700,"end":706},"category":"Protein"}]}
