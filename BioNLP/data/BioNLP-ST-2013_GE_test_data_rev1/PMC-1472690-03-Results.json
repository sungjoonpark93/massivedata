Previous studies reported that beta-1 to 3-D-glucans induced only a limited cytokine secretion of human blood cells [15-18]. Corroborating and extending these singular findings in terms of examining pro- (eight) as well as anti- (three) inflammatory cytokines over time (48 h) and six additional transcription factor binding sites, our comprehensive analysis revealed the following cytokine profile of human leukocytes in response to a highly purified water soluble beta-1 to 3-D-glucan and in comparison to two pro-inflammatory mediators (LPS, TSST-1):\n(i) IL-1beta\nThere was no IL-1beta production detectable following PBMC treatment with 1 nor 100 mug GP. An insignificant up-regulation of IL-1beta production for GP + LPS was observed in comparison with LPS. For GP + TSST-1 we found a significant reduction in IL-1beta from 18 h - 24 h, for the latter by about 40% when compared to TSST-1 or the theoretical value of GP/TSST-1 calc. (n = 6; both p = 0.01). On the whole, GP mediated a reduction of the TSST-1-induced amount of IL-1beta by about 50% (Fig. 3A).\n(ii) IL-6\nGP induced only a small amount of IL-6 and there was no significant alteration of the LPS-induced IL-6 production by GP. On the contrary, we observed a decreased IL-6 production for GP + TSST-1 when compared to TSST-1 or GP/TSST-1 calc., especially at 24 h by about 40% (n = 5; both p = 0.02), (data not shown in detail).\n(iii) IL-8\nWe found that GP induced a substantial IL-8 production, in comparison with medium control, especially at 24 h (n = 13; p < 0.01). A combination of GP and LPS resulted in a non-significant increase of IL-8 production when compared to LPS or GP/LPS calc. There was no significant alteration in IL-8 production following GP + TSST-1 when compared to TSST-1 or GP/TSST-1 calc. (data not shown in detail).\n(iv) IL-1RA\nBesides IL-8, IL-1RA was the only mediator which was produced in significant quantities following GP treatment, especially at 24 h (n = 14, p < 0.01). When compared to LPS stimulation or GP/LPS calc., GP + LPS did not alter the kinetic course of the IL-1RA production. However, following GP + TSST-1 we found a synergistic increase in IL-1RA production from 18 h to 48 h, when compared to TSST-1 (for instance at 24 h: n = 6; p = 0.01) or to the theoretical value of GP/TSST-1 calc. (from 18 h to 36 h). Over the time course of 48 h, GP elevated the TSST-1-induced amount of IL-1RA by approximately 200% (Fig. 3B).\nPositive correlation between GP-induced IL-8 and IL-1RA productions. Following stimulation with GP (24 h), we observed a positive correlation between IL-8 and IL-1RA. Moreover, we found this correlation to be dose-dependent, since 100 mug of GP induced larger amounts of IL-8 and IL-1RA than 1 mug GP (n = 5, p <= 0.002, r = 0.9 and 0.98, respectively).\n(v) TNFalpha\nWith respect to TNFalpha production, 100 mug of GP yielded minor, statistically not distinguishable amounts, when compared to medium control. GP + LPS did not change the TNFalpha production when compared to LPS supplementation or GP/LPS calc. When combined with TSST-1 or GP/TSST-1 calc., GP seemed to exert a synergistic effect on TNFalpha secretion after 36 h (n = 3; p < 0.05), but overall an enhancement of only 10% was observed (p > 0.05; data not shown in detail).\n(vi) IFNgamma\nNo IFNgamma production was detectable following treatment of PBMC with 100 mug GP. There was a minor increase in IFNgamma production following GP + LPS at 36 h, when compared to LPS or GP/LPS calc., and a slight down-regulation following GP + TSST-1 at 24 h and 36 h, when compared to TSST-1 or GP/TSST-1 calc. (data not shown).\n(vii) IL-2, IL-12, IL-4, IL-10, TGFbeta1\nThe production of IL-2, IL-12, IL-4, IL-10 and TGFbeta 1 was not induced by GP. There were also no significant differences between medium control, LPS, TSST-1, GP, GP + LPS, GP/LPS calc. and GP + TSST-1 or GP/TSST-1 calc. over 48 h (data not shown).","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":79,"end":85},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":109,"end":115},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":178,"end":186},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":188,"end":192},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":194,"end":198},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":203,"end":211},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":303,"end":311},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":313,"end":317},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":319,"end":323},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":325,"end":333},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":917,"end":923},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":930,"end":938},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":952,"end":960},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1065,"end":1073},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1144,"end":1150},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1187,"end":1195},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1259,"end":1265},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1297,"end":1303},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1379,"end":1385},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1404,"end":1412},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":1442,"end":1446},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":1481,"end":1485},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":1545,"end":1549},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":1609,"end":1613},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":1634,"end":1640},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":1658,"end":1664},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":1671,"end":1677},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":1775,"end":1779},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":1819,"end":1823},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":1980,"end":1984},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T31","span":{"begin":2072,"end":2076},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T32","span":{"begin":2103,"end":2109},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T33","span":{"begin":2127,"end":2133},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T34","span":{"begin":2140,"end":2146},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T35","span":{"begin":2186,"end":2192},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T36","span":{"begin":2201,"end":2205},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T37","span":{"begin":2207,"end":2213},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T38","span":{"begin":2443,"end":2449},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T39","span":{"begin":2486,"end":2492},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T40","span":{"begin":2528,"end":2534},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T41","span":{"begin":2582,"end":2588},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T42","span":{"begin":2663,"end":2669},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T43","span":{"begin":2743,"end":2749},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T44","span":{"begin":2768,"end":2774},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T45","span":{"begin":2848,"end":2852},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T46","span":{"begin":2857,"end":2863},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T47","span":{"begin":2958,"end":2962},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T48","span":{"begin":2967,"end":2973},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T49","span":{"begin":3079,"end":3083},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T50","span":{"begin":3088,"end":3094},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T51","span":{"begin":3166,"end":3174},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T52","span":{"begin":3191,"end":3199},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T53","span":{"begin":3345,"end":3353},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T54","span":{"begin":3437,"end":3443},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T55","span":{"begin":3450,"end":3456},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T56","span":{"begin":3507,"end":3515},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T57","span":{"begin":3651,"end":3659},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T58","span":{"begin":3663,"end":3671},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T59","span":{"begin":3773,"end":3781},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T60","span":{"begin":3903,"end":3909},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T61","span":{"begin":3945,"end":3951},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T62","span":{"begin":3958,"end":3964},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T63","span":{"begin":3995,"end":3999},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T64","span":{"begin":4001,"end":4006},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T65","span":{"begin":4008,"end":4012},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T66","span":{"begin":4014,"end":4019},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T67","span":{"begin":4021,"end":4029},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T68","span":{"begin":4048,"end":4052},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T69","span":{"begin":4054,"end":4059},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T70","span":{"begin":4061,"end":4065},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T71","span":{"begin":4067,"end":4072},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T72","span":{"begin":4077,"end":4086},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T73","span":{"begin":4182,"end":4188},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T74","span":{"begin":4226,"end":4232},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T75","span":{"begin":4239,"end":4245},"category":"Pr
