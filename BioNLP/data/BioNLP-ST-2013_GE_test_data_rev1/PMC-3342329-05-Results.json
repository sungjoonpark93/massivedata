Among 40 tested cytokines, the levels of IL-1Ra, MIG, MIP-1alpha increased about 686, 9 and 25-fold respectively, in CCR5-/- mice compared to CCR5+/+ mice. Using this technique, no other cytokines were found to be different between the CCR5-/- mice and the CCR5+/+ mice (Figure 4B). Similar altered cytokine levels were found in the spleens of CCR5-/- mice (Figure 4C). Since the IL-1Ra level was the most significantly elevated, the expression of IL-1Ra in tumor and spleen tissues was analyzed by immunofluorescence and western blotting. The expression of IL-1Ra was upregulated in tumor and spleen tissues of the CCR5-/- mice (Figure 4D-G).","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":16,"end":22},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":50,"end":54},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":160,"end":164},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":172,"end":176},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":305,"end":311},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":313,"end":316},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":318,"end":328},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":381,"end":385},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":406,"end":410},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":500,"end":504},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":521,"end":525},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":608,"end":612},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":644,"end":650},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":712,"end":718},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":822,"end":828},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":880,"end":884},"category":"Protein"}]}
