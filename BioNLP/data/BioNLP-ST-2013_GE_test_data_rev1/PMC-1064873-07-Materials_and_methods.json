Real-time PCR was performed with the LightCycler Instrument (Roche Diagnostics, Penzberg, Germany) in glass capillaries. The reaction mix containing Taq DNA polymerase and DNA double-strand-specific SYBR Green I dye (Lightcycler FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I; Roche Diagnostics) and specific primers were added to cDNA dilutions.\nThe cDNA samples were denatured at 95degrees C for 10 min, and were then amplified for 40-50 cycles: at 95degrees C (10 s), at 65degrees C (15 s), and 72degrees C (22 s) for beta-actin; at 95degrees C (10 s), at 62degrees C (15 s), and at 72degrees C (10 s) for SOCS1; and at 96degrees C (10 s), at 68degrees C (15 s), and at 72degrees C (15 s) for SOCS3. Amplification curves of the fluorescence values versus cycle number were obtained, and a melting curve analysis was then performed. The levels of SOCS1 and SOCS3 expression were determined by normalizing relative to beta-actin expression. The forward and reverse primers were as follows: for beta-actin, 5'-GTGGGGCGCCCCAGGCACCA-3' and 5'-CTCCTTAATGTCACGCACGATTTC-3' ; for SOCS1, 5'-AGACCCCTTCTCACCTCTTG-3' and 5'-GCACAGCAGAAAAATAAAGC-3' ; and for SOCS3, 5'-CCCGCCGGCACCTTTCTG-3' and 5'-AGGGGCCGGCTCAACACC-3'.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":77,"end":80},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":541,"end":544},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":900,"end":910},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":988,"end":993},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":1075,"end":1080},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":1228,"end":1233},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":1238,"end":1243},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":1298,"end":1308},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1374,"end":1384},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1454,"end":1459},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1529,"end":1534},"category":"Protein"}]}
