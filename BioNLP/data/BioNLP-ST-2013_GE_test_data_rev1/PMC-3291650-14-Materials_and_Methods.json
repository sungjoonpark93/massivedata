IFNalpha and IFNbeta protein levels were determined with an ELISA kit (PBL Biomedical Laboratories). For IFNgamma ELISA, 96-well plates were coated with IFNgamma coating (XMG1.2) and detection (R4-6A2) antibodies (eBiosciences). Detection of MCP-1, KC, TNF, IL-1beta and IL-6 in BAL fluid was performed using Bioplex (BioRad) technology according to the manufacturer's instructions. Milliplex technology (Millipore) was used for the detection of MIP-2 in BAL fluid.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":28,"end":31},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":71,"end":74},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":166,"end":173},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":395,"end":400},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":402,"end":404},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":406,"end":409},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":411,"end":419},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":424,"end":428},"category":"Protein"}]}
