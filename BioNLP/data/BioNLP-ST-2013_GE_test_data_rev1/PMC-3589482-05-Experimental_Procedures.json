Membranes were subsequently blocked with 5% milk in PBS-T (1X PBS, 0.1% Tween-20), and incubated with primary antibodies overnight. Affinity purified rabbit anti-mouse SerpinB2 antibodies were prepared after immunization with a purified recombinant GST-murine SerpinB2 fusion protein produced in E. coli as in [35]. Other antibodies used for western blot assays include: C/EBP-beta (sc-150) (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and alpha/beta tubulin (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.).","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":504,"end":538},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":626,"end":636},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":676,"end":716},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":718,"end":723},"category":"Protein"}]}
