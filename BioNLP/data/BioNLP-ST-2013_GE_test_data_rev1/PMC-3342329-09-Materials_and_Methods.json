The mice were housed and bred under specific pathogen free conditions at the Laboratory Animal Research Center of Chungbuk National University, Korea. The mice (n = 4/cage) were maintained in a room with a constant temperature of 22+/-1degreesC, relative humidity of 55+/-10%, and 12-h light/dark cycle, and fed standard rodent chow (Samyang, Korea) and purified tap water ad libitum. The CCR5+/+ mice (n = 20) and CCR5-/- mice (n = 20), that were used, had matched ages (10-11 weeks old) and weights (16-19 g). Control mice (B6129PF2/J) were F2 hybrid mice from the C57BL/6J-AW-J and 129P3/J parental strains. CCR5 mice (B6, 129P2-Ccr5tm1Kuz/J) have the entire coding region of the CCR5 gene deleted from the parental strains, B6;129P2-Ccr5tm1kuz and B6;129P2-Cmkbr5tm1Kuz.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":12,"end":16},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":28,"end":32},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":41,"end":45},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":56,"end":60},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":533,"end":537},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":559,"end":563},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":755,"end":759},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":827,"end":831},"category":"Protein"}]}
