Band shifts were determined after 1 h incubation with GP as described before, including mutated oligos for NFIL-6 (TTA CAA CAG TGG ATT GCG ACA CTT AGT GGG) and NFATP2/3 (GGC GCA GAA AAG GTA AAA TAT TTA CTA TCT) binding sites within the IL-1RA promoter. PBMC RNA was isolated with an RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Germany) and messenger RNA was transcribed into cDNA with Reactin Ready First Strand kit (Biomol) and analysed for IL-1RA and GAPDH transcripts by PCR with a HotStart \"sweet\" PCR mastermix (Biomol) (95degreesC, 30 sec, 55degreesC, 30 sec, 72degreesC, 30 sec, 25 cycles for IL-1RA and 94degreesC for 30 sec, 50degreesC for 30 sec and 72degreesC for 45 sec, 25 cycles for GAPDH) following 18 h incubation with GP. IL-1RA protein was measured in the supernatant by ELISA after 24 h incubation with GP.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":105,"end":111},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":597,"end":603},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":650,"end":656},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":657,"end":658},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":726,"end":732},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":908,"end":914},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":919,"end":924},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":1205,"end":1211},"category":"Protein"}]}
