The ability of endogenous C/EBP-beta to direct transcription from the SerpinB2 proximal promoter was examined by transfection of the pGLmP-539 murine SerpinB2 luciferase reporter construct into Cebpb+/+ and Cebpb-/- MEFs. We found that LPS-stimulated SerpinB2 promoter activity was significantly increased in Cebpb+/+ MEFs and abrogated in Cebpb-/- MEFs (Fig. 8A), indicating that endogenous C/EBP-beta is required for LPS-induced SerpinB2 proximal promoter activity.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":10},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":41,"end":49},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":83,"end":93},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":107,"end":115},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":233,"end":243},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":303,"end":311},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":376,"end":386},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":420,"end":428},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":500,"end":528},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":544,"end":549},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":557,"end":562},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":601,"end":609},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":659,"end":664},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":690,"end":695},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":742,"end":752},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":781,"end":789},"category":"Protein"}]}
