Cells were stained, fixed and permeabilized (Cytofix/Cytoperm, BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Activated CD8+ T cells were analyzed by flow cytometry based on CD62lo CD3+ and CD8+ expression. Live/Dead fixable aqua dead cell stain kit (Molecular Probes) was used to discriminate live from dead cells.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":22,"end":25},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":61,"end":64},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":74,"end":84},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":86,"end":89},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":115,"end":118},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":517,"end":520},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":578,"end":581},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":587,"end":590},"category":"Protein"}]}
