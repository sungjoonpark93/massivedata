{"source_db":"PMC","source_id":"1472690","division_id":8,"section":"Conclusion","text":"In summary, our data demonstrated that in vitro glucan phosphate induced a transcription factor binding and a subsequent cytokine profile different from LPS and also from TSST-1 and, moreover, switched a pro-inflammatory TSST-1-induced response to an IL-1RA-mediated anti-inflammatory reaction. Our results also generated new insights into a very complex interplay of transcription factor binding to various known and newly identified sites in the IL-1RA promoter (Fig. 8), which can be regulated differentially by a fungal carbohydrate. Together with the in vivo studies [22,37], our findings might support the concept of protective effects mediated by glucan phosphate in pro-inflammatory conditions, especially with a dysregulated IL-1beta/IL-1RA ratio [52,53].","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":171,"end":177},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":221,"end":227},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":251,"end":257},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":448,"end":454},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":734,"end":742},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":743,"end":749},"category":"Protein"}]}
