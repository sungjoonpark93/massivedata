The location of the 5' ends of the -539, -189 and -87 reporter constructs is also shown. Positions of murine SerpinB2 proximal promoter-specific primers, 338/-315 and -5/+19 used in ChIP assays are indicated. (B) RAW 264.7 macrophages were transiently transfected with the indicated murine SerpinB2 promoter-luciferase reporter constructs and either left untreated or treated with 100 ng/ml LPS for 16 hrs. The results show relative luciferase activity following LPS treatment and represent the mean and SEM of 4-7 independent experiments.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":88,"end":96},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":173,"end":181},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":384,"end":392},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":565,"end":602},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":708,"end":718},"category":"Protein"}]}
