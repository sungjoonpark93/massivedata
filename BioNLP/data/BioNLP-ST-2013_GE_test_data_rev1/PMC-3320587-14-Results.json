After transfection of the monocytic THP-1 cell line with these plasmids, cells were stimulated with an irradiated whole cell lysate of MTb (H37Rv). We note that MTb lysate induces inflammatory responses in monocytes that resemble those induced in response to live MTb (see for example, [35]-[37]). Upon stimulation, the B, C, and E LTR-driven reporters demonstrated a significant enhancement in luciferase activity (Figure 1A) and the magnitude of this effect was subtype-specific. Subtype C LTRs displayed the strongest activity, while the LTRs from subtype E isolates consistently showed the weakest activity (Figure 1A), consistent with previous studies demonstrating subtype-specific LTR activity that used TNF as a stimulus [38], [39].","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":317,"end":327},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":738,"end":748},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":1054,"end":1057},"category":"Protein"}]}
