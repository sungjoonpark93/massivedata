Consisting of six members, the C/EBP transcription factors can homo-/heterodimerize and display similar DNA binding specificities [60]. Four family members, C/EBP-alpha, C/EBP-beta, C/EBP-delta and C/EBP-epsilon, are present in myeloid cells and play different roles in differentiating myeloid cells depending on the extracellular environment [61]. To determine which C/EBP proteins were involved in the formation of the different nucleo-protein complexes, and particularly of the LPS-inducible complex, EMSA was performed after incubating the nucleo-protein complexes with antibodies specific for C/EBP-alpha, C/EBP-beta, C/EBP-delta and C/EBP-epsilon. Each antibody detects the carboxy-terminal DNA-binding region of the respective protein, so that pre-incubation of antibody with nuclear extract is expected to abolish DNA binding by EMSA [62]. Only antibodies against C/EBP-beta abolished the formation of the LPS-inducible complex (Fig. 5C). Taken together these data show that the LPS-induced complex with the C/EBP element (-203/-192) contains C/EBP-beta.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":10},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":82,"end":90},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":406,"end":417},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":419,"end":429},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":431,"end":442},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":447,"end":460},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":847,"end":858},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":860,"end":870},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":872,"end":883},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":888,"end":901},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1121,"end":1131},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1300,"end":1310},"category":"Protein"}]}
