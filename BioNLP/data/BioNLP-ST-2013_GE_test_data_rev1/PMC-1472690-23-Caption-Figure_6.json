Time course (48 h) of the IL-1beta/IL-1RA ratio following incubation of human PBMC with LPS, TSST-1, GP + LPS, GP/LPS calc., GP + TSST-1 or GP/TSST-1 calc. LPS and GP + LPS treatments resulted in generating more IL-1beta than IL-1RA up to 24 h. When comparing LPS or GP/LPS calc. vs GP + LPS we did not find significant alterations in the IL-1beta/IL-1RA ratio over 48 h. With respect to TSST-1 or GP/TSST-1 calc. vs GP + TSST-1 we observed a pronounced anti-inflammatory action of GP, as demonstrated by an about 10-100 fold reduced ratio at 18 h and 24 h, i.e. a higher production of IL-1RA than of IL-1beta (* = p < 0.05). Data are shown as mean +/- SEM (n = 3).","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":10,"end":18},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":19,"end":25},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":47,"end":53},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":71,"end":77},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":105,"end":113},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":114,"end":120},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":172,"end":178},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":209,"end":215},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":222,"end":228},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":291,"end":299},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":305,"end":311},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":418,"end":426},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":427,"end":433},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":467,"end":473},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":480,"end":486},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":501,"end":507},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":665,"end":671},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":680,"end":688},"category":"Protein"}]}
