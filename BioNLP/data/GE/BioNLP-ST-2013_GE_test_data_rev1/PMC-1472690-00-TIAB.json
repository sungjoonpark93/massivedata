Employing a comprehensive methodological approach, the aim of our in vitro study was to elucidate novel molecular and cellular mechanisms of human peripheral blood immune cells mediated by a fungal beta-1 to 3-D-glucan, i.e. glucan phosphate, in the presence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 (TSST-1).\nResults\nDespite an activation of nuclear factor (NF)kappaB, NFinterleukin(IL)-6 and NFAT similar to LPS or TSST-1, we observed no significant production of IL-1beta, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha or interferon gamma induced by glucan phosphate. Glucan phosphate-treated leukocytes induced a substantial amount of IL-8 (peak at 18 h: 5000 pg/ml), likely due to binding of NFkappaB to a consensus site in the IL-8 promoter. An increase in IL-1receptor antagonist(RA) production (peak at 24 h: 12000 pg/ml) by glucan phosphate-treated cells positively correlated with IL-8 levels. Glucan phosphate induced significant binding to a known NFIL-6 site and a new NFAT site within the IL-1RA promoter, which was confirmed by inhibition experiments. When applied in combination with either LPS or TSST-1 at the same time points, we detected that glucan phosphate elevated the LPS- and the TSST-1-induced DNA binding of NFkappaB, NFIL-6 and NFAT, leading to a synergistic increase of IL-1RA. Further, glucan phosphate modulated the TSST-1-induced inflammatory response via reduction of IL-1beta and IL-6. As a consequence, glucan phosphate shifted the TSST-1-induced IL-1beta/IL-1RA ratio towards an anti-inflammatory phenotype. Subsequently, glucan phosphate decreased the TSST-1-induced, IL-1-dependent production of IL-2.\nConclusion\nThus, beta-1 to 3-D-glucans may induce beneficial effects in the presence of pro-inflammatory responses, downstream of receptor binding and signaling by switching a pro- to an anti-inflammatory IL-1RA-mediated reaction. Our results also offer new insights into the complex regulation of the IL-1RA gene, which can be modulated by a beta-1 to 3-D-glucan.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":77,"end":81},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":127,"end":135},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":136,"end":160},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":585,"end":613},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":615,"end":621},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":684,"end":703},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":708,"end":712},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":731,"end":737},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":780,"end":788},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":790,"end":794},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":796,"end":823},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":827,"end":843},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":941,"end":945},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1035,"end":1039},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1065,"end":1088},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1089,"end":1091},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1193,"end":1197},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1305,"end":1311},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1416,"end":1422},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1508,"end":1514},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":1548,"end":1554},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":1559,"end":1563},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":1602,"end":1608},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":1650,"end":1656},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":1704,"end":1712},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":1717,"end":1721},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":1770,"end":1776},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":1785,"end":1793},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":1794,"end":1800},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":1892,"end":1898},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T31","span":{"begin":1908,"end":1912},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T32","span":{"begin":1937,"end":1941},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T33","span":{"begin":2148,"end":2154},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T34","span":{"begin":2245,"end":2251},"category":"Protein"}]}
