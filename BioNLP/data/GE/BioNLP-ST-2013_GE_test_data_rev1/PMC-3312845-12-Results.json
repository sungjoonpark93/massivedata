In 12 hr-post SE animals of the saline-infused group, most of the activated microglia showed strong TNF-alpha immunoreactivity (Figure 1A). This expression pattern was maintained up to 1 week after SE. In non-SE-induced animals of the saline-infused groups, TNFp55R and TNFp75R immunoreactivities were also weakly observed in astrocytes (data not shown). In 12 hr-post SE animals of the saline-infused group, TNFp55R immunoreactivity was observed in astrocytes (Figure 1B). Unlike TNFp55R, TNFp75R immunoreactivity was detected in endothelial cells as well as astrocytes (Figures 1C-E). One day to 1 week after SE, both TNFp55R and TNFp75R immunoreactivities were significantly reduced in astrocytes, not in endothelial cells, due to massive astroglial loss (data not shown) [5,7,8,20].","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":9},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":95,"end":104},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":274,"end":283},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":432,"end":439},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":444,"end":451},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":583,"end":590},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":655,"end":662},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":664,"end":671},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":794,"end":801},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":806,"end":813},"category":"Protein"}]}
