(B) Cell under serum free condition were treated with bFGF or bFGF/zVAD.fmk for the indicated amounts of time, followed by western blotting using the indicated antibodies. (C) Necroptosis was induced by zVAD.fmk or TNFalpha in L929 cell in the presence of inhibitors of Akt(Akt inh. VIII) and mTOR (rapamycin, Torin-1 and PI-103). (D) L929 cells with mTOR siRNA knockdown were harvested for western blot or treated with zVAD.fmk or TNFalpha for 24 hrs. Cell viability was determined 24 hr after activation of necroptosis. In all graphs, average+/-SD was plotted.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":98,"end":106},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":202,"end":206},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":210,"end":214},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":363,"end":371},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":580,"end":588},"category":"Protein"}]}
