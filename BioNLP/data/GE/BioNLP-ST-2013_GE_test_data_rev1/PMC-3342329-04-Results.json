Apoptotic cell death in the tumor sections were evaluated in the CCR5+/+ and CCR5-/- mice that were inoculated with melanoma cells. TUNEL staining revealed a higher frequency of apoptotic cell death in the tumor tissues of the CCR5-/- mice than that of the CCR5+/+ mice (Figure 3A). Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence showed that high levels of cleaved caspase-3 and Bax were found more frequently in the CCR5-/- mice than in the CCR5+/+ mice (Figure 3B and 3C). Consistent with the immunohistochemical data, Western blot analysis of tumor proteins showed greater increased levels of cleaved caspase-3, cleaved caspase-9, cleaved PARP and Bax, whereas the levels of Bcl-2 and C-IAP1 were significantly decreased in CCR5-/- mice tissues (Figure 3D).","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":97,"end":101},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":457,"end":461},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":469,"end":473},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":619,"end":623},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":649,"end":653},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":805,"end":809},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":830,"end":834},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":1076,"end":1082},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1115,"end":1119},"category":"Protein"}]}
