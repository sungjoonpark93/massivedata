To evaluate whether the tumor inhibition was related with the inactivation of NF-kappaB in melanoma, the DNA binding activity of NF-kappaB was determined by electromobility shift assay (EMSA) in melanoma tissue. The constitutively activated DNA binding activity was reduced in the CCR5-/- mice tumor tissue (Figure 2A). Moreover, the translocation of p50 and p-p65 into the nucleus through the inhibition of phosphorylation of IkappaB was also prevented in the tumor tissues of CCR5-/- mice (Figure 2B). Immunofluorescence analysis also confirmed that the intensity of nuclear staining for p50 had decreased in the tumor tissues of CCR5-/- mice (Figure 2C).","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":50,"end":54},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":178,"end":182},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":476,"end":480},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":546,"end":549},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":556,"end":559},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":673,"end":677},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":785,"end":788},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":827,"end":831},"category":"Protein"}]}
