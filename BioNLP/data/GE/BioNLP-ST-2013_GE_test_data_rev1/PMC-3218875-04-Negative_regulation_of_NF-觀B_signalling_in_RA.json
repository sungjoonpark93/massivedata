{"source_db":"PMC","source_id":"3218875","division_id":4,"section":"Negative regulation of NF-\u03baB signalling in RA","text":"Since NF-kappaB activation is so crucial to many cellular processes, a tight regulation of the NF-kappaB signalling pathway and the genes it induces is an absolute requirement to fine-tune the inflammatory response. Moreover, terminating an NF-kappaB response is essential to prevent persistent NF-kappaB activation that may lead to chronic inflammation and/or tumorigenesis. To achieve this, cells employ different mechanisms, including the expression of inhibitory proteins that downregulate NF-kappaB signalling [32]. Below we give an overview of a number of proteins that are involved in the dampening or termination of the NF-kappaB response, some of them under the control of NF-kappaB itself and thus acting in a negative feedback loop. In addition, we discuss the potential role of these NF-kappaB inhibitory factors in the immunopathology of RA. Several other proteins involved in the negative regulation of NF-kappaB-dependent inflammatory responses, such as MyD88s, IRAK-M, and TOLLIP, have been described (reviewed in [33]). These proteins are not discussed here, since a link with RA pathology has not yet been reported.Although IKK1 is a critical component of the non-canonical NF-kappaB pathway, it should be mentioned that this kinase also plays a prominent role in the negative regulation of both canonical and noncanonical NF-kappaB pathways. Macrophages from IKK1-deficient mice or knockin mice expressing inactive IKK1 show increased production of proinflammatory cytokines as a result of enhanced IKK2 activation and IkappaBalpha degradation [34]. IKK1 has also been shown to inhibit nuclear NF-kappaB and to downregulate proinflammatory signalling by phosphorylating STAT1 [35]. Interestingly, a recent study has demonstrated that IKK1 phosphorylates NIK in negative feedback regulation of the noncanonical NF-kappaB pathway [36], supporting the idea that IKK1 plays important roles in terminating both canonical and noncanonical NF-kappaB pathways with possible implications for chronic inflammatory diseases like RA.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":969,"end":975},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":977,"end":983},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":989,"end":995},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":1142,"end":1146},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":1378,"end":1382},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":1434,"end":1438},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":1518,"end":1522},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":1538,"end":1550},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1569,"end":1573},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1689,"end":1694},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1753,"end":1757},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1773,"end":1776},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1878,"end":1882},"category":"Protein"}]}
