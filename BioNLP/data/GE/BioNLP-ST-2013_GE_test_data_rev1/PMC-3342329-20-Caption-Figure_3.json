The apoptotic index was determined as the number of DAPI-stained, TUNEL-positive cells that were counted. Values are the mean +/- S.D. of four experimental animals. * indicates statistically significant differences from CCR5+/+ mice. Scale bar indicates 50 microm. B and C, Apoptotic protein (cleaved caspase-3 and Bax) in tumor sections were detected by immunofluorescence assay. The reactive cell number was determined as the number of DAPI-stained, Specific antibody (cleaved caspase-3 and Bax)-positive cells that were counted. Values are the mean +/- S.D. of four experimental animals. * indicates statistically significant differences from CCR5+/+ mice. Scale bar indicates 50 microm. D, The expression of apoptotic proteins was detected by Western blotting using specific antibodies; cleaved caspase-3, cleaved caspase-9, cleaved PARP, Bax, Bcl-2 and c-IAP1 in the tumor tissues. The beta-actin protein was used as an internal control. Each band is representative of three independent experimental results. Data are means +/- S.D. of three experimental animals. * indicates significant difference from CCR5+/+ mice (p<0.05).","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":54,"end":58},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":435,"end":439},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":861,"end":865},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":1073,"end":1079},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":1106,"end":1116},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":1324,"end":1328},"category":"Protein"}]}
