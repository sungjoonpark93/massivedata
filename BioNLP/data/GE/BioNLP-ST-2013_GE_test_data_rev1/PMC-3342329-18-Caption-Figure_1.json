B16 melanoma cells (5x105 cells/mouse) were inoculated s.c. into CCR5+/+ mice and CCR5-/- mice (n = 20). Tumor volumes were measured every day and tumor weights were measured at study termination (Day 31). The CCR5-/- mice had a significant reduction in tumor growth and volume as compared to CCR5+/+ mice. The results are expressed as mean +/- SD. * indicates significant difference from CCR5+/+ mice (P<0.05). D, The CCR5-/- mice demonstrated significantly higher survival rates compared to CCR5+/+ mice (by Log-rank Test). E. Tumor sections were analyzed by H&E stain and expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) by immunohistochemistry. Data are means +/- S.D. of four experimental animals. * indicates significant difference from CCR5+/+ mice (P<0.05). Scale bar indicates 50 m.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":35,"end":39},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":155,"end":159},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":172,"end":176},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":300,"end":304},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":383,"end":387},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":479,"end":483},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":509,"end":513},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":583,"end":587},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":840,"end":844},"category":"Protein"}]}
