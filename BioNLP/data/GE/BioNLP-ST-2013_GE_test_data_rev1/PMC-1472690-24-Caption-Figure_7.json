A, A representative autoradiogram (lane 1: control, lane 2: GP, lane 3: GP + unlabeled mutated NFATP2/3 oligo, lane 4: GP + CAPE, lane 5: GP + CyA, lane 6: GP + CHX, lane 7: GP + unlabeled NFATP2/3 oligo, lane 8: water) as well as a graphical summary for the NFATP2/3 site, depicting a decrease in binding following inhibition when compared to GP is displayed (* = p < 0.05). Data are shown as mean +/- SEM (n = 4). B, Inhibition of NFkappaB, NFAT and NFIL-6 resulted in decreased IL-1RA mRNA following CHX, CAPE or CyA compared to GP. GAPDH is used as housekeeping control (representative gel, n = 4). C, Inhibition of NFkappaB, NFAT and NFIL-6 significantly reduced the production of IL-1RA by human PBMC following treatment with CHX, CAPE or CyA when compared to GP (* = p < 0.05; ** = p < 0.01). Data are shown as mean +/- SEM (n = 3).","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":35,"end":39},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":44,"end":50},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":70,"end":76},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":530,"end":534},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":539,"end":545},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":568,"end":574},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":623,"end":628},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":717,"end":721},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":726,"end":732},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":773,"end":779},"category":"Protein"}]}
