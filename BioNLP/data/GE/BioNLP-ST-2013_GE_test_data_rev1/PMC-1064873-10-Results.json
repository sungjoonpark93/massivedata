To evaluate the responsiveness of RA CD4+ T cells to IL-10, purified PB CD4+ T cells from three patients with active RA and from three healthy controls were stimulated by immobilized anti-CD3 antibody and anti-CD28 antibody with or without diluted concentrations of IL-10 for 36 hours, and IFN-gamma production was measured by ELISA. As shown in Fig. 1, IFN-gamma production by activated normal CD4+ T cells was mostly inhibited at concentrations as low as 1 ng/ml IL-10. However, RA CD4+ T cells were able to produce significant amounts of IFN-gamma in the presence of 1 ng/ml IL-10, and the maximal but not complete inhibition by IL-10 was obtained at 10-100 ng/ml.\nWe thus compared the levels of IFN-gamma production by CD4+ T cells after CD3 and CD28 costimulation in the presence of 1 ng/ml IL-10 in RA patients with active disease (multiple inflammatory joints, CRP level >= 10 mg/l) and inactive disease (in remission, CRP level < 10 mg/l) [26] and in healthy controls. There were no statistically significant differences in IFN-gamma production without IL-10 among these three groups (Fig. 2a), but the inhibitory effect of IL-10 on IFN-gamma production was significantly limited in the active RA group as compared with the inactive RA group and healthy controls (percentage decrease: active RA, 2.9 +/- 14.4%; inactive RA, 45.6 +/- 14.4%; controls, 65.8 +/- 7.9%) (Fig. 2b). As a consequence, CD4+ T cells from active RA patients produced higher levels of IFN-gamma in the presence of 1 ng/ml IL-10 than did normal CD4+ T cells (Fig. 2a).\nIn addition, we compared IL-2 production by CD4+ T cells after CD3 and CD28 costimulation in the presence of IL-10 in active RA patients and in healthy controls. Similarly, IL-2 production was not affected by 1 ng/ml IL-10 in RA patients (percentage decrease, -2.1 +/- 13.8%), while it was significantly reduced in healthy controls (61.1 +/- 13.7%; P < 0.05). Taken together, these results indicate that RA CD4+ T cells become less susceptible to the immunoregulatory effect of IL-10 during the active phase.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":14,"end":19},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":34,"end":43},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":61,"end":64},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":78,"end":82},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":179,"end":184},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":235,"end":239},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":353,"end":356},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":369,"end":374},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":388,"end":391},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":504,"end":507},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":526,"end":530},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":582,"end":587},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":606,"end":615},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":670,"end":679},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":711,"end":714},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":781,"end":786},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":800,"end":803},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":857,"end":866},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":894,"end":899},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":948,"end":953},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":1015,"end":1024},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":1039,"end":1042},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":1058,"end":1061},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":1066,"end":1070},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":1112,"end":1117},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":1348,"end":1357},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":1377,"end":1382},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":1448,"end":1453},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":1457,"end":1466},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":1718,"end":1721},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T31","span":{"begin":1781,"end":1790},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T32","span":{"begin":1818,"end":1823},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T33","span":{"begin":1840,"end":1843},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T34","span":{"begin":1889,"end":1893},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T35","span":{"begin":1908,"end":1911},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T36","span":{"begin":1935,"end":1939},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T37","span":{"begin":1973,"end":1978},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T38","span":{"begin":2037,"end":2041},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T39","span":{"begin":2081,"end":2086},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T40","span":{"begin":2271,"end":2274},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T41","span":{"begin":2342,"end":2347},"category":"Protein"}]}
