Interleukin (IL)-17 is an important regulator of immune and inflammatory responses, including the induction of proinflammatory cytokines and osteoclastic bone resorption. Evidence for the expression and proinflammatory activity of IL-17 has been demonstrated in RA synovium and in animal models of RA. Although some cytokines (IL-15 and IL-23) have been reported to regulate IL-17 production, the intracellular signaling pathways that regulate IL-17 production remain unknown. In the present study, we investigated the role of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway in the regulation of IL-17 production in RA. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from patients with RA (n = 24) were separated, then stimulated with various agents including anti-CD3, anti-CD28, phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and several inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. IL-17 levels were determined by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The production of IL-17 was significantly increased in cells treated with anti-CD3 antibody with or without anti-CD28 and PHA (P < 0.05). Among tested cytokines and chemokines, IL-15, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and IL-6 upregulated IL-17 production (P < 0.05), whereas tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-18 or transforming growth factor-beta did not. IL-17 was also detected in the PBMC of patients with osteoarthritis, but their expression levels were much lower than those of RA PBMC. Anti-CD3 antibody activated the PI3K/Akt pathway; activation of this pathway resulted in a pronounced augmentation of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) DNA-binding activity. IL-17 production by activated RA PBMC is completely or partly blocked in the presence of the NF-kappaB inhibitor pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate and the PI3K/Akt inhibitor wortmannin and LY294002, respectively. However, inhibition of activator protein-1 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 did not affect IL-17 production. These results suggest that signal transduction pathways dependent on PI3K/Akt and NF-kappaB are involved in the overproduction of the key inflammatory cytokine IL-17 in RA.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":10,"end":24},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":68,"end":71},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":263,"end":282},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":494,"end":499},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":590,"end":595},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":600,"end":605},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":638,"end":643},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":707,"end":712},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":827,"end":830},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":860,"end":865},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1034,"end":1038},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1040,"end":1058},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1060,"end":1063},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1116,"end":1121},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1262,"end":1267},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1357,"end":1361},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1366,"end":1369},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1421,"end":1426},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1428,"end":1462},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1467,"end":1471},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":1484,"end":1489},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":1521,"end":1548},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":1550,"end":1558},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":1560,"end":1565},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":1569,"end":1600},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":1610,"end":1615},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":1783,"end":1786},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":1920,"end":1925},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":2074,"end":2077},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":2150,"end":2169},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T31","span":{"begin":2174,"end":2213},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T32","span":{"begin":2214,"end":2215},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T33","span":{"begin":2231,"end":2236},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T34","span":{"begin":2323,"end":2326},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T35","span":{"begin":2409,"end":2414},"category":"Protein"}]}
