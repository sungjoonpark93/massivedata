We observed a dose-dependent increase in IL-17 mRNA transcripts after stimulation with anti-CD3; this was inhibited by the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 and by the NF-kappaB inhibitor PDTC (Fig. 5).","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":5},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":57,"end":62},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":243,"end":248},"category":"Protein"}]}
