Similarly, in 1 day-post SE animals of the saline-infused group, loss of SMI-71 immunoreactivity was detected in layer III/IV of the PC as compared to non-SE animals (Figures 4B and 5C-E, p < 0.05). Thus, loss of SMI-71 immunoreactivity correlated with volume of vasogenic edema following SE. This reduction in SMI-71 was accompanied by increased p65-Thr435 phosphorylation (Figures 5C-D). Therefore, the degree of SMI-71 immunoreactivity was inversely correlated to p65-Thr435 phosphorylation with a linear coefficient of correlation of -0.6324 (p < 0.05; Figure 4C). In addition, sTNFp55R infusion effectively alleviated p65-Thr435 phosphorylation and preserved SMI-71 immunoreactivity in endothelial cells following SE, as compared to saline infusion (p < 0.05; Figures 4A-B, 5D and 5F).","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":491,"end":494},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":611,"end":614},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":727,"end":734},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":767,"end":770},"category":"Protein"}]}
