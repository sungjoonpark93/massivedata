Binding was up-regulated for GP + LPS and GP + TSST-1, when compared to GP and, in the latter case, to both GP and TSST-1 (* = p < 0.05). Human PBMC were incubated with medium control, LPS, TSST-1, GP, GP + TSST-1 and GP + LPS for 1 h at 37degreesC. Schematic representation of the elevated NFAT-DNA binding activity to the site in the IL-1RA promoter. Bars depicting the theoretical values for GP/LPS calc. and GP/TSST-1 calc. are added. Medium control levels were set equal to 1 +/- SEM (n = 6). An autoradiogram of a representative experiment is shown in the lower panel (lane 1: water; lane 2: medium control; lane 3: GP; lane 4: LPS; lane 5: TSST-1, lane 6: GP + LPS; lane 7: GP + TSST-1).","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":13,"end":19},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":70,"end":76},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":134,"end":140},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":202,"end":208},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":277,"end":283},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":294,"end":300},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":378,"end":382},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":423,"end":429},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":502,"end":508},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":734,"end":740},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":773,"end":779},"category":"Protein"}]}
