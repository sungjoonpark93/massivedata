Expression of TLR4 Protein Increased in Brain Tissue after ICH\nTo investigate the increased TLR4 at the protein level, the expression of TLR4 protein was measured in brain tissue by the method of Western Blots using specific antibodies for TLR4. Our results showed that a low level of TLR4 protein was detectable in the saline control group. The expression of TLR4 significantly increased starting from 6 hours after ICH (P < .05), peaked on the 3rd day after ICH, and then decreased but still maintained at a high level on the 7th day after ICH (P < .05, Figure 2). This observation of TLR4 protein was consistent with the temporal profile of the TLR4 mRNA after ICH.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":19,"end":23},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":97,"end":101},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":142,"end":146},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":245,"end":249},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":290,"end":294},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":365,"end":369},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":592,"end":596},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":653,"end":657},"category":"Protein"}]}
