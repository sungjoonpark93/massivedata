As expected, an inhibition of NFkappaB via CAPE [35] and CyA, NFAT via CyA and NFIL-6 via CHX [36] could not be overruled by GP, leading to a down-regulated binding activity of the transcription factors to the IL-1RA sites, and a reduction of IL-1RA mRNA and IL-1RA protein levels (Fig. 7). The extent of reduction in NFATP2/3 binding is exemplarily shown in an autoradiogram (Fig. 7A, left side) and graphically summarized (n = 4, Fig. 7A, right side). The results for the NFkappaB and NFIL-6 binding sites were similar (data not shown). Because the highest IL-1RA amount was found at 24 h, mRNA was examined following 1 h inhibition and 18 h of GP. A representative gel demonstrating a decrease in IL-1RA mRNA after inhibition with CAPE, CyA and CHX is displayed in Fig. 7B (n = 4). In addition, corresponding IL-1RA protein levels after 24 h of GP are shown in Fig. 7C (n = 3). Altogether, NFkappaB inhibition by CAPE was more pronounced at the binding activity and the transcription, whereas CyA and CHX mainly led to a decreased IL-1RA release.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":51,"end":57},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":164,"end":170},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":214,"end":220},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":290,"end":294},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":307,"end":313},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":438,"end":444},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":471,"end":477},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":487,"end":493},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":787,"end":793},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":928,"end":934},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1040,"end":1046},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1262,"end":1268},"category":"Protein"}]}
