{"source_db":"PMC","source_id":"3312845","division_id":17,"section":"Results","text":"MIP-2 expression\nMIP-2 is a powerful chemokine that contributes to recruitment of neutrophils [27]. MIP-2 is undetectable or present at low levels under physiological conditions, and shows transient increases under pathological conditions via TNF-alpha and/or interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta)-dependent mechanisms [14]. Thus, it would be plausible that TNF-alpha-mediated MIP-2 expression may provoke SE-induced neutrophil infiltrations. To confirm this hypothesis, we investigated MIP-2 expression in the PC. Consistent with our previous study [20], some MIP-2-positive astrocytes were observed in the core and periphery of the vasogenic edema lesions, but not in the non-vasogenic edema region (Figure 6B and 6C). Although the number of MIP-2 positive cells per unit area in the PC region of sTNFp55R-infused animals was significantly lower than that of the saline-infused group due to reduction of the area of vasogenic edema, there was no difference in the number of MIP-2 positive cells per unit area of vasogenic edema between sTNFp55R-infused animals and saline-infused animals (Figure 6F). Furthermore, the number of MIP-2-positive cells showed a direct proportion to the unit area of vasogenic edema with a linear coefficient of correlation of 0.682 (p < 0.05, Figure 6G). Therefore, together with reduction in neutrophil infiltration in the PC region of sTNFp55R-infused animals, our findings provide evidence that TNF-alpha may regulate SE-induced neutrophil infiltration at least in the PC via vasogenic edema formation and not via direct TNF-alpha-mediated MIP-2 expression in astrocytes.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":5},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":17,"end":22},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":37,"end":46},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":100,"end":105},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":243,"end":252},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":260,"end":277},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":279,"end":287},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":349,"end":358},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":368,"end":373},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":478,"end":483},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":552,"end":557},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":735,"end":740},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":791,"end":798},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":967,"end":972},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1030,"end":1037},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1121,"end":1126},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1361,"end":1368},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1421,"end":1430},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1547,"end":1556},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1566,"end":1571},"category":"Protein"}]}
