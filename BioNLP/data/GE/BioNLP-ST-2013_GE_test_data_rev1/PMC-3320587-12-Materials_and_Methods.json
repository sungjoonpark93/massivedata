The reaction conditions were 95degreesC for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95degreesC for 15 sec and 60degreesC for 1 min. The results were normalized using beta-actin mRNA as an internal control and expressed as relative values.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":301,"end":311},"category":"Protein"}]}
