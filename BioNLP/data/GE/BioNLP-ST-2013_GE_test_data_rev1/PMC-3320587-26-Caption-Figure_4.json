PBMC from four normal donors were infected with 1000 TCID50 HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-WT or the mutants HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-kappaB I-Mut, HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-kappaB II-Mut, HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-kappaB I+II-Mut, or HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-N5-Mut and either; (A) left untreated, or (B) co-infected with MTb isolate CDC1551 (10:1 cells:bacilli). Viral p24 levels in culture supernatants were measured at days 4, 7 and 12 post-infection. (C) Histograms show viral p24 levels at day 12 in the MTb uninfected (grey bars) and MTb co-infected (black bars) PBMC cultures. Replication of the mutant viruses was compared to wild-type virus replication under the same experimental conditions (without and with MTb co-infection, respectively). *, p<0.05; **, p<0.01, as compared to HIV-1Lai/Bal-Env-WT.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":60,"end":65},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":332,"end":335},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":367,"end":370},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":398,"end":401},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":430,"end":433},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":467,"end":470},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":582,"end":585},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":693,"end":696},"category":"Protein"}]}
