Wild-type MEFs express low levels of endogenous SerpinB2 and the absence of C/EBP-beta attenuated endogenous SerpinB2 mRNA expression. LPS stimulated an increase in SerpinB2 mRNA expression in wild-type MEFs (Fig. 6A), whereas LPS-stimulated SerpinB2 mRNA expression was significantly dampened in Cebpb-/- MEFs as compared to wild-type. We next tested if similar effects could be seen in thioglycollate-elicited inflammatory macrophages in which C/EBP-beta expression was knocked down using species-specific lentiviral shRNAs (Fig. 6B, left). As was observed in MEFs, both constitutive and LPS-induced SerpinB2 mRNA expression was significantly decreased in C/EBP-beta-deficient inflammatory macrophages (Fig. 6B, right). These data show that C/EBP-beta is critical for mediating constitutive and LPS-inducible transcription of endogenous SerpinB2 mRNA.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":10},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":54,"end":62},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":157,"end":167},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":182,"end":190},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":239,"end":249},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":256,"end":261},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":286,"end":291},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":352,"end":362},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":412,"end":420},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":440,"end":450},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":473,"end":481},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":529,"end":537},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":606,"end":614},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":661,"end":666},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":810,"end":820},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":966,"end":974},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1022,"end":1032},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1107,"end":1117},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1203,"end":1211},"category":"Protein"}]}
