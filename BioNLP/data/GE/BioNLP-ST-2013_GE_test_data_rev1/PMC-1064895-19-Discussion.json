RA is characterized by hyperplasia of synovial lining cells and an intense infiltration by mononuclear cells [23]. Proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 and TNF-alpha are abundant in rheumatoid synovium, whereas the T cell-derived cytokines, especially IL-4 and interferon-gamma, have often proved difficult to detect in RA synovium [24]. Although T cells may have a role in the augmentation of rheumatoid synovial inflammation, the lack of T cell-derived cytokines has limited its importance. In this respect, IL-17 is appealing because it has been described as a T cell-derived cytokine with proinflammatory properties.\nIn our studies, we tried to evaluate how IL-17 production is regulated in RA PBMC, and which signaling pathway it used. Levels of IL-17 were found to be higher in RA synovial fluid than in OA synovial fluid [15]. However, there are few data available on the agents that stimulate IL-17 production in RA, although the highest level of IL-17 production can be achieved by anti-CD3/anti-CD28 stimulation in healthy individuals [25]. In our experiments, PHA as mitogens, as well as anti-CD3/anti-CD28 for signaling through the T cell receptor, increased IL-17 production from RA PBMC in a dose-dependent manner. We found, by a cell proliferation assay (data not shown), that this upregulation of IL-17 might be due to increased cellular activity rather than to cellular proliferation.\nIL-17 is produced mainly by activated CD4+ T cells, especially for Th1/Th0 cells, not the Th2 phenotype [26]. However, it can also be produced by CD8+ T cells via an IL-23 triggering mechanism in Gram-negative pulmonary infection [14]. In addition, IL-17 production was significantly augmented by T cells recognizing type II collagen in a collagen-induced arthritis model [27]. A complex interaction between cells in inflamed RA joints might produce a variety of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which also activate other cells in the joints. For example, IL-17 stimulates rheumatoid synoviocytes to secrete several cytokines such as IL-6, IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor-stimulated gene 6 as well as prostaglandin E2 in vitro [12,28,29]. There are as yet few data available on the agents that stimulate IL-17 production in RA, although some cytokines (IL-15 and IL-23) have been known to regulate IL-17 production [13,14]. We therefore investigated the in vitro production of IL-17 in RA PBMC responding to a variety of cytokines/chemokines and mitogens as well as T cell receptor (TCR) ligation using anti-CD3/anti-CD28. Our studies demonstrated that IL-15 and MCP-1 as well as TCR ligation significantly increased the production of IL-17 in RA PBMC. Adding IL-15 or MCP-1 to TCR ligation augmented IL-17 production more markedly. In contrast, IL-1 and TNF-alpha, which are known to have proinflammatory properties and to be increased in RA joints, did not affect IL-17 production. Our data were consistent with a recent report that IL-15 triggered in vitro IL-17 production in PBMC, but TNF-alpha did not do so [13]. Although there were no data that MCP-1 directly induces T cell activation, it might exert effects indirectly on T cells through the activation of monocytes/macrophages in PBMC cultures. As reported for normal individuals [25], T cell activation through anti-CD3/anti-CD28 also increases IL-17 induction in RA PBMC.\nAlthough the signaling pathway for the induction of cytokines/chemokines by IL-17 has been documented widely [8,30,31], no data have been available on how IL-17 production can be regulated by certain signaling pathways. By using signal transduction inhibitors, we therefore examined which signaling pathway was mainly involved in the induction of IL-17 in RA PBMC.\nWe identified that anti-CD3-induced IL-17 production in RA PBMC was significantly hampered by the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 and the NF-kappaB inhibitor PDTC to comparable levels of basal production without stimulation. We also found that anti-CD3-induced IL-17 production was downregulated by the addition of SB203580, a p38 MAPK inhibitor. It is interesting that a series of evidence supports crosstalk between NF-kappaB and p38. In myocytes, IkappaB kinase-beta is activated by p38 [32], and the activated p38 can stimulate NF-kappaB by a mechanism involving histone acetylase p300/CREB-binding protein [33]. Our results revealed that p38 MAPK activation was not affected by LY294002, whereas NF-kappaB binding activity was decreased by LY294002, which provided the evidence for a p38 MAPK pathway independent of PI3K activation. The direct relationship between p38 and NF-kappaB for IL-17 production needs to be studied in future experiments.\nThe search for a downstream pathway of PI3K seemed to have a maximal response of Akt activation at 1 hour and a gradual loss of activity at 2 hours. The fact that Akt is phosphorylated upon anti-CD3 stimulation suggests the possible involvement of PI3K in the induction of IL-17 in RA. In view of the fact that NF-kappaB was also activated by anti-CD3/anti-CD28, IL-15 or mitogens in our experiments, it is most likely that the NF-kappaB pathway is also actively involved in the induction of IL-17 in RA PBMC. In contrast, the AP-1 signal transduction pathway, another important signaling pathway for cytokines/chemokines, was not activated in our experiments (data not shown). Although PI3K and its downstream kinase Akt in association with NF-kappaB have been reported to deliver activating signals in many cell types, the data on the signal inducing IL-17 are lacking. Our data clearly demonstrated that PI3K/Akt and resultant NF-kappaB activation could be an important arbitrator of the upregulation of IL-17 in RA, on the basis of our experiments showing simultaneous blocking of NF-kappaB binding activity in the IL-17 promoter by PDTC and LY294002. Considering its proinflammatory activities and successful induction of anti-IL-17 for ameliorating arthritis in animal models [2,6,34-36], understanding the IL-17 signaling pathway is an important element of developing new targeted therapies in RA.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":5},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":235,"end":239},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":244,"end":253},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":340,"end":344},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":349,"end":365},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":598,"end":603},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":750,"end":755},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":839,"end":844},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":989,"end":994},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1043,"end":1048},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1093,"end":1097},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1159,"end":1162},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1201,"end":1205},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1259,"end":1264},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1401,"end":1406},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1490,"end":1495},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1528,"end":1531},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1636,"end":1639},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1656,"end":1661},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1739,"end":1744},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":2055,"end":2060},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":2133,"end":2137},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":2139,"end":2143},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":2148,"end":2187},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":2302,"end":2307},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":2351,"end":2356},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":2361,"end":2366},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":2396,"end":2401},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":2475,"end":2480},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":2615,"end":2619},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T31","span":{"begin":2651,"end":2656},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T32","span":{"begin":2661,"end":2666},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T33","span":{"begin":2733,"end":2738},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T34","span":{"begin":2758,"end":2763},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T35","span":{"begin":2767,"end":2772},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T36","span":{"begin":2799,"end":2804},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T37","span":{"begin":2844,"end":2848},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T38","span":{"begin":2853,"end":2862},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T39","span":{"begin":2964,"end":2969},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T40","span":{"begin":3033,"end":3038},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T41","span":{"begin":3058,"end":3063},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T42","span":{"begin":3088,"end":3097},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T43","span":{"begin":3151,"end":3156},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T44","span":{"begin":3385,"end":3389},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T45","span":{"begin":3405,"end":3410},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T46","span":{"begin":3509,"end":3514},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T47","span":{"begin":3588,"end":3593},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T48","span":{"begin":3780,"end":3785},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T49","span":{"begin":3822,"end":3825},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T50","span":{"begin":3834,"end":3839},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T51","span":{"begin":4051,"end":4056},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T52","span":{"begin":4240,"end":4259},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T53","span":{"begin":4375,"end":4379},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T54","span":{"begin":4380,"end":4400},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T55","span":{"begin":4682,"end":4687},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T56","span":{"begin":4823,"end":4826},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T57","span":{"begin":4905,"end":4908},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T58","span":{"begin":5015,"end":5020},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T59","span":{"begin":5099,"end":5103},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T60","span":{"begin":5105,"end":5110},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T61","span":{"begin":5234,"end":5239},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T62","span":{"begin":5269,"end":5273},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T63","span":{"begin":5460,"end":5463},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T64","span":{"begin":5595,"end":5600},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T65","span":{"begin":5654,"end":5657},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T66","span":{"begin":5749,"end":5754},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T67","span":{"begin":5861,"end":5866},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T68","span":{"begin":5974,"end":5979},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T69","span":{"begin":6055,"end":6060},"category":"Protein"}]}
