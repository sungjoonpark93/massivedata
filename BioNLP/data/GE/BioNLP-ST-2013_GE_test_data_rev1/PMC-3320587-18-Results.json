This series of experiments also allowed us to dissect the relative importance of NFAT5 and NF-kappaB binding to the HIV-1 LTR in MTb regulation of HIV-1 replication.\nTo perform these experiments, we constructed a panel of infectious HIV-1Lai/Bal-env molecular clones where either the NFAT5 site was specifically disrupted or the two NF-kappaB binding sites were either individually or dually disrupted (Figure 3A). Specifically, we constructed a clone in which the NFAT5 binding site was mutated (named HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-N5-Mut) by changing the CC dinucleotide to TT in the core NFAT5 binding site and introduced substitution mutations into the NF-kappaB/NFAT5 shared binding element that we predicted would disrupt NF-kappaB binding but preserve NFAT5 binding. Specifically, we mutated two guanines (GG) in the kappaB I site and changed them to thymine and adenine (TA) (HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-kappaB I-mut) and also introduced the same GG to TA change in the second, more distal NF-kappaB site (kappaB II) in HIV-1Lai/Bal-env (HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-kappaB II-Mut). We also created a double NF-kappaB site mutant virus (HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-kappaB I+II-Mut) in order to test the impact of complete disruption of NF-kappaB binding to the HIV-1 LTR on MTb regulation.\nTo determine the specificity of these substitutions upon NFAT5 and NF-kappaB p50/p65 binding to the LTR, we performed a quantitative DNase I footprinting analysis using the wild-type LTR or mutant LTRs in combination with increasing concentrations of recombinant NFAT5 or NF-kappaB p50/p65 proteins. As shown in Figure 3B, the N5-Mut LTR could not bind NFAT5 (compare lanes 12-15 and lanes 17-20), but p50/p65 binding was not impaired (compare lanes 2-5 with lanes 7-10). By contrast, changing the GG dinucleotide to TA in either NF-kappaB binding motif, as predicted, inhibited p50/p65 binding at each site (compare lanes 2-5 with lanes 7-10 and lanes 12-15 of Figure 3C). As expected, mutation of both NF-kappaB sites (kappaB I+II-Mut) resulted in abrogation of p50/p65 binding to the LTR. However, recombinant NFAT5 binding to the single and the double NF-kappaB mutant LTRs was not impaired and indeed appeared enhanced (compare lanes 2-5 to lanes 7-20 of Figure 3D). Thus, binding of NFAT5 or NF-kappaB p50/p65 to their respective motifs can be specifically disrupted within an overlapping or shared binding site.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":14,"end":19},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":109,"end":114},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":214,"end":219},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":263,"end":268},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":310,"end":315},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":464,"end":469},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":629,"end":632},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":899,"end":902},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1129,"end":1134},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1267,"end":1270},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1400,"end":1403},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1418,"end":1421},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1505,"end":1508},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1691,"end":1696},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1711,"end":1714},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1715,"end":1718},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1767,"end":1774},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1897,"end":1902},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1916,"end":1919},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1920,"end":1923},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":1987,"end":1992},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":2036,"end":2039},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":2040,"end":2043},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":2213,"end":2216},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":2217,"end":2220},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":2398,"end":2401},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":2402,"end":2405},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":2447,"end":2452},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":2623,"end":2628},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":2642,"end":2645},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T31","span":{"begin":2646,"end":2649},"category":"Protein"}]}
