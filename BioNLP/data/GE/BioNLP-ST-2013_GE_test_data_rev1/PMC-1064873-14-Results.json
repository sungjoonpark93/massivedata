SOCS3 has recently been shown to specifically inhibit STAT3 activation induced by IL-6 but not by IL-10, thereby regulating the divergent action of IL-6 and IL-10 [8,9]. On the contrary, SOCS1 is able to partially inhibit IL-10-mediated STAT3 activation and cellular responses, as well as IFN-gamma-mediated STAT1 activation [32]. To determine whether SOCSs were involved in the defective IL-10-induced STAT3 activation of RA CD4+ T cells, the levels of SOCS1 and SOCS3 mRNA expression in PB CD4+ T cells from active RA patients and from healthy controls were compared by semiquantitative real-time PCR. The RA CD4+ T cells contained higher levels of SOCS1 but lower levels of SOCS3 transcripts than did control CD4+ T cells (Fig. 6a). Constitutive expression of SOCS1 mRNA in RA CD4+ T cells was comparable with the expression in normal CD4+ T cells stimulated by 10 ng/ml IL-6 (Fig. 6b), supporting its functional significance. Defective IL-10-induced STAT3 activation therefore appears to be due at least in part to an abundance of SOCS1 in RA CD4+ T cells.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":19,"end":24},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":36,"end":39},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":49,"end":53},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":93,"end":98},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":103,"end":108},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":285,"end":290},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":339,"end":344},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":367,"end":371},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":383,"end":388},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":433,"end":437},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":442,"end":447},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":472,"end":477},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":507,"end":512},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":522,"end":527},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":574,"end":583},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":593,"end":598},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":674,"end":679},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":688,"end":693},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":711,"end":714},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":739,"end":744},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":749,"end":754},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":777,"end":780},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":896,"end":899},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":936,"end":941},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":962,"end":967},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":997,"end":1000},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":1048,"end":1053},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":1065,"end":1068},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":1123,"end":1126},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":1159,"end":1163},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T31","span":{"begin":1225,"end":1230},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T32","span":{"begin":1239,"end":1244},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T33","span":{"begin":1320,"end":1325},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T34","span":{"begin":1332,"end":1335},"category":"Protein"}]}
