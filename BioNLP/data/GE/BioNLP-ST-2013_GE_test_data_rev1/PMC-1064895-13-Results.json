On the basis of this, we chose 10 mug/ml as a stimulation concentration for anti-CD3. As shown in Table 1, anti-CD3 significantly upregulated IL-17 production up to 3.7-fold, and the combination of anti-CD28 and anti-CD3 produced more IL-17 (approximately 1.3-1.5-fold) than anti-CD3 alone. Furthermore, when incubated with T cell mitogens such as PHA, increased IL-17 production was more pronounced than with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 (588 +/- 85 versus 211 +/- 1 pg/ml; P < 0.05).","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":10,"end":15},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":79,"end":83},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":89,"end":92},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":101,"end":106},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":344,"end":349},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":517,"end":522},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":578,"end":582},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":610,"end":615},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":723,"end":726},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":738,"end":743},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":803,"end":807},"category":"Protein"}]}
