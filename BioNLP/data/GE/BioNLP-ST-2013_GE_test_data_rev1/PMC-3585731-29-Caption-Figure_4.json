(B,C) L929 cells were stimulated by zVAD.fmk or TNFalpha (B) or bFGF/zVAD.fmk under serum free conditions (C). Akt inh. VIII was added 15 min before necroptotic stimulation (Pre) or at indicated times after stimulation. Viability was measured 24 hr after activation of necroptosis. (D) L929 cells were stimulated with bFGF/zVAD under serum free conditions. PD173074 was added 15 min before or 1 hr after FGF/zVAD. Samples for western blot were collected at 15 min and 9 hr time points. (E) Cells were pretreated with PD173074 or it was added 1 hr after bFGF/zVAD.fmk, followed by viability assessment at 24 hr. In all graphs, average+/-SD was plotted.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":109,"end":113},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":229,"end":237},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":245,"end":249},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":499,"end":503},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":734,"end":738},"category":"Protein"}]}
