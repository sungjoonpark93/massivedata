CD40 and RANK can activate the noncanonical NF-kappaB pathway that is dependent on NF-kappaB inducing kinase (NIK) expression levels. In unstimulated cells NIK forms a cytosolic complex with the ubiquitin ligases TRAF2, TRAF3 and cIAP1/2, which facilitates the K48-linked polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of NIK, keeping NIK levels low. Upon ligand binding, TRAF3 is recruited to the receptor, where TRAF2 directs nondegradative K63-linked polyubiquitination of cIAP1/2, resulting in their activation. Subsequently cIAP1/2 directs its K48-linked polyubiquitination to TRAF3, rather than NIK. As a result, TRAF3 is degraded and NIK is stabilised, resulting in increased NIK levels in the cell. NIK then phosphorylates and activates IKK1, which mediates NF-kappaB p100 phosphorylation. This is followed by K48-linked polyubiquitination and partial proteasomal degradation of p100 to p52, which forms a heterodimer with RelB to activate transcription. Next to TRAF3, TRAF1 has also been identified as a negative regulator of this pathway, most probably by competing with other TNF receptor-associated factors. cIAP, cellular inhibitor of apoptosis; IKK, IkappaB kinase; NF, nuclear factor; RANK, receptor activator of NF-kappaB; TRAF, TNF receptor-associated factor; TNF, tumour necrosis factor.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":35,"end":39},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":44,"end":48},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":118,"end":143},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":145,"end":148},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":191,"end":194},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":248,"end":253},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":255,"end":260},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":265,"end":270},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":271,"end":272},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":357,"end":360},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":370,"end":373},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":407,"end":412},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":449,"end":454},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":511,"end":516},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":517,"end":518},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":564,"end":569},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":570,"end":571},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":617,"end":622},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":636,"end":639},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":654,"end":659},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":676,"end":679},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":718,"end":721},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":742,"end":745},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":780,"end":784},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":811,"end":815},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":922,"end":926},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":930,"end":933},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":966,"end":970},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":1006,"end":1011},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":1013,"end":1018},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T31","span":{"begin":1236,"end":1240},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T32","span":{"begin":1242,"end":1273},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T33","span":{"begin":1313,"end":1316},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T34","span":{"begin":1318,"end":1340},"category":"Protein"}]}
