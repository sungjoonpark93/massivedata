Proinflammatory cytokines released from these cells are known to be important in the destruction of joints in RA [1]. The favorable clinical benefits obtained with inhibitors of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha) and interleukin (IL)-1 suggest that the blockade of key inflammatory cytokines has been the important issue in the development of new therapeutic applications [2].\nA little over a decade ago, the primacy of T cells in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease such as RA was undisputed because they are the largest cell population infiltrating the synovium. However, a series of studies demonstrated paucity of T cell-derived cytokines such as IL-2 and interferon-gamma in the joints of RA, whereas macrophage and fibroblast cytokines including IL-1, IL-6, IL-15, IL-18 and TNF-alpha were abundant in rheumatoid synovium. This paradox has questioned the role of T cells in the pathogenesis of RA [3]. Because we have already demonstrated the enhanced proliferation of antigen specific T cells, especially to type II collagen, and the skewing of T helper type 1 (Th1) cytokines in RA [4], the role of T cells needs to be elucidated in different aspects.\nIL-17 is one of the inflammatory cytokines secreted mainly by activated T cells, which can induce IL-6 and IL-8 by fibroblasts [5]. This cytokine is of interest for two major reasons: first, similarly to TNF-alpha and IL-1, IL-17 has proinflammatory properties; second, it is produced by T cells [6]. Recent observations demonstrated that IL-17 can also activate osteoclastic bone resorption by the induction of RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear factor kappaB [NF-kappaB] ligand), which is involved in bony erosion in RA [7]. It also stimulates the production of IL-6 and leukemia inhibitory factor by synoviocytes, and of prostaglandin E2 and nitric oxide by chondrocytes, and has the ability to differentiate and activate the dendritic cells [8-10]. Levels of IL-17 in synovial fluids were significantly higher in patients with RA than in patients with osteoarthritis (OA), and it was produced by CD4+ T cells in the synovium [11,12].\nIL-15, secreted from activated macrophages, has been reported to be an important trigger of IL-17 production in RA peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) by cyclosporine and steroid sensitive pathways [13]. Recently, Happel and colleagues also showed that IL-23 could be an efficient trigger of IL-17 production from both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells [14].\nAlthough the contribution of IL-17 in joint inflammation in RA has been documented in earlier studies [12,15,16], the intracellular signal transduction pathway for IL-17 production remains uncertain. In the present study we used various stimuli to investigate IL-17 production in PBMC of patients with RA and its signaling transduction pathway.\nWe found that the intracellular signaling pathway involving phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and NF-kappaB might be involved in the overproduction of the key inflammatory cytokine IL-17 in RA. These results might provide new insights into the pathogenesis of RA and future directions for new therapeutic strategies in RA.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":307,"end":340},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":346,"end":364},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":783,"end":787},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":792,"end":808},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":884,"end":888},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":890,"end":894},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":896,"end":901},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":903,"end":908},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":913,"end":922},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1292,"end":1297},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1390,"end":1394},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1399,"end":1403},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1496,"end":1505},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1510,"end":1514},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1516,"end":1521},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1631,"end":1636},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1704,"end":1709},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1711,"end":1773},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1858,"end":1862},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1867,"end":1893},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":2057,"end":2062},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":2194,"end":2197},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":2232,"end":2237},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":2324,"end":2329},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":2491,"end":2496},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":2530,"end":2535},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":2557,"end":2560},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":2566,"end":2569},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":2614,"end":2619},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":2749,"end":2754},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T31","span":{"begin":2845,"end":2850},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T32","span":{"begin":3023,"end":3026},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T33","span":{"begin":3114,"end":3119},"category":"Protein"}]}
