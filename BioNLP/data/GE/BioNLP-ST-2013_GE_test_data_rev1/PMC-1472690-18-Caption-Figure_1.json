{"source_db":"PMC","source_id":"1472690","division_id":18,"section":"Caption-Figure 1","text":"A, GP led to DNA binding of NFAT, NFkappaB and NFIL-6. Human PBMC were incubated with medium control or GP (1 and 100 mug) for 1 h at 37degreesC. Nuclear extracts were incubated with a 32P-labeled NFAT, NFkappaB, NFIL-6 or NFkappaB-IL-8 oligonucleotide probe corresponding to the IFNgamma, TNFalpha, IL-6 and IL-8 gene promoters (Table 1). Arrows with the black head indicate migrational location of the NFAT-DNA, NFkappaB-DNA, NFIL-6-DNA or NFkappaB-IL-8-DNA complex compared to free probe (no shift). Arrow with the open head indicates a supershift of NFkappaB-IL-8-DNA-anti-p65 and -p50, respectively. An autoradiogram from a representative experiment is shown (n = 7). B, Decreased DNA binding of NFkappaB following GP + TSST-1, compared to TSST-1, GP, or TSST-1/GP. Human PBMC were incubated with medium control, LPS, TSST-1, GP (100 mug), GP + TSST-1 and GP + LPS for 1 h at 37degreesC. An autoradiogram from a representative experiment is shown. Schematic representation of NFkappaB-DNA binding activity following GP (1 and 100 mug) or TSST-1 treatment (250 ng) as well as simultaneous administration of both compounds and the theoretical value (GP/TSST-1 calc.). Medium control levels were set equal to 1+/- SEM and significances (* = p < 0.05) are shown with respect to medium control (n = 4).","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":28,"end":32},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":47,"end":53},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":197,"end":201},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":213,"end":219},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":232,"end":236},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":280,"end":288},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":290,"end":298},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":300,"end":304},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":309,"end":313},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":404,"end":408},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":428,"end":434},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":451,"end":455},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":563,"end":567},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":577,"end":580},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":586,"end":589},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":725,"end":731},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":745,"end":751},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":760,"end":766},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":823,"end":829},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":850,"end":856},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":1043,"end":1049},"category":"Protein"}]}
