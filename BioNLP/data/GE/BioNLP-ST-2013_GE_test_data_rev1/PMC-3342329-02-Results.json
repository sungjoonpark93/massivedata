B16-F0 melanoma cells were inoculated subcutaneously into CCR5+/+ and CCR5-/- mice (n = 20). Tumor growth was monitored for 31 days. Tumor growth in the CCR5-/- mice was significantly lower than that in the CCR5+/+ mice. The tumor growth in the CCR5-/- mice was reduced to 19.1%, whereas the tumor growth in the CCR5+/+ mice was only reduced to 24.3%, in both tumor weight (Figure 1A and 1B) and tumor volume, respectively (Figure 1A and 1C). These results correlated with mice survival rates. There was a significant difference in survival rates between CCR5-/- mice (75% of starting time) and CCR5+/+ mice (15%) at the end of the experiment (Figure 1D). There was a significant difference in survival rates between CCR5-/- mice and CCR5+/+ mice. At the end of the experiment, 75% of the CCR5-/- mice survived while only 15% of the CCR5+/+ mice survived. Subcutaneous tumors were harvested from the sacrificed mice 31 days after inoculation. The immunohistochemical analysis of tumor sections, stained with H&E and for proliferation antigen PCNA, revealed greater inhibition of tumor cell growth in CCR5-/- mice. The histologic findings after H&E staining indicated that the tumor tissues of the CCR5-/- mice, but not those of the CCR5+/+ mice, contained large areas of necrosis. PCNA reactive cells were significantly reduced in the CCR5-/- mice (Figure 1E).","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":35,"end":39},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":62,"end":66},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":111,"end":115},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":123,"end":127},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":195,"end":199},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":207,"end":211},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":290,"end":294},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":344,"end":348},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":382,"end":386},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":449,"end":453},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":692,"end":696},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":732,"end":736},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":854,"end":858},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":871,"end":875},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":926,"end":930},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":970,"end":974},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1237,"end":1241},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1334,"end":1338},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1369,"end":1373},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1472,"end":1476},"category":"Protein"}]}
