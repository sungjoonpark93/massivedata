Data was normalized to mouse 18S RNA. (B) Necroptosis was induced by zVAD.fmk or TNFalpha in cells treated with Nec-1, rapamycin (rapa), or Akt inh.

(C-F) L929 cells with siRNA knockdown of Akt isoforms (C,E) or mTOR (D,F) were stimulated with zVAD.fmk or TNFalpha for 9 hr, followed by qRT-PCR analysis of mTNFalpha (C,D) or western blot (E,F). In all graphs, average+/-SD was plotted.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":33,"end":41},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":147,"end":151},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":227,"end":236},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":267,"end":270},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":319,"end":327},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":429,"end":437},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":558,"end":566},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":609,"end":618},"category":"Protein"}]}
