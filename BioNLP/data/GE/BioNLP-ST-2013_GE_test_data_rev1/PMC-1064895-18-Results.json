As shown in Fig. 7a, nuclear extracts from RA PBMC stimulated with anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 (lane 2) demonstrated increased binding of NF-kappaB to IL-17 promoters in comparison with that of controls (lane 1). A supershift assay demonstrated shifted bands in p65 and p50 (lanes 3 and 4) not in c-Rel (lane 5). In normal PBMC the same pattern was observed, but the degree of NF-kappaB activation by anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 was less intense than that in RA PBMC (Fig. 7b). To confirm the link between PI3K activity and NF-kappaB, we performed EMSA to determine the NF-kappaB binding activity after treatment with both LY294002 and PDTC. Both agents block NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity in the IL-17 promoter (Fig. 7c). Western blotting for IkappaB-alpha showed inhibition of degradation of IkappaB-alpha by LY294002 and PDTC at the same time (Fig. 7c). In contrast, the AP-1 pathway was not activated by stimulation with anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 (data not shown), demonstrating that NF-kappaB is the main intracellular signaling pathway in IL-17 production by activated PBMC from patients with RA.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":32,"end":51},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":53,"end":57},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":74,"end":79},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":187,"end":191},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":209,"end":212},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":217,"end":222},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":253,"end":258},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":382,"end":387},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":475,"end":479},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":536,"end":541},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":647,"end":650},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":655,"end":658},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":682,"end":687},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":805,"end":809},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1079,"end":1084},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1126,"end":1139},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1176,"end":1189},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1256,"end":1260},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1326,"end":1330},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1425,"end":1430},"category":"Protein"}]}
