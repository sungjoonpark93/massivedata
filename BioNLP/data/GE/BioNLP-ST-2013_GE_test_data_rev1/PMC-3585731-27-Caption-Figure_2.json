Cell viability was determined after 24 hrs. (C) L929 cells transfected with Akt1, Akt2, and Akt3 siRNAs for 72 hrs were treated with zVAD.fmk or TNFalpha for 9 hrs. Cell viability and Akt expression levels were determined after 24 hrs. In all graphs, average+/-SD was plotted.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":55,"end":63},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":110,"end":118},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":362,"end":366},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":368,"end":372},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":378,"end":389},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":431,"end":439},"category":"Protein"}]}
