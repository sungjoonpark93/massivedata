CCR5-/- mice showed reduced tumor volume, tumor weight, and increased survival rate when compared to CCR5+/+ mice. We investigated the activation of NF-kappaB since it is an implicated transcription factor in the regulation of genes involving cell growth, apoptosis, and tumor growth. Significant inhibition of DNA binding activity of NF-kappaB, and translocation of p50 and p65 into the nucleus through the inhibition of phosphorylation of IkappaB was found in the melanoma tissues of CCR5-/- mice compared to melanoma tissues of CCR5+/+ mice. NF-kappaB target apoptotic protein expression, such as cleaved caspase-3, cleaved PARP, and Bax, was elevated, whereas the survival protein expression levels, such as Bcl-2, C-IAP1, was decreased in the melanoma tissues of CCR5-/- mice. Interestingly, we found that the level of IL-1Ra, a tumor growth suppressive cytokine, was significantly elevated in tumor tissue and spleen of CCR5-/- mice compared to the level in CCR5+/+ mice. Moreover, infiltration of CD8+ cytotoxic T cell and CD57+ natural killer cells was significantly increased in melanoma tumor and spleen tissue of CCR5-/- mice compared to that of CCR5+/+ mice. Therefore, these results showed that CCR5 deficiency caused apoptotic cell death of melanoma through inhibition of NF-kappaB and upregulation of IL-1Ra.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":14,"end":38},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":112,"end":118},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":166,"end":195},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":197,"end":201},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":268,"end":272},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":283,"end":287},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":312,"end":316},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":327,"end":331},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":428,"end":432},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":694,"end":697},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":702,"end":705},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":813,"end":817},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":858,"end":862},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1046,"end":1052},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1095,"end":1099},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1151,"end":1157},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1253,"end":1257},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1291,"end":1295},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1451,"end":1455},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1484,"end":1488},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":1535,"end":1539},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":1643,"end":1649},"category":"Protein"}]}
