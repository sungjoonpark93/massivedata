To confirm TNF-alpha-mediated signaling following SE, we performed an immunohistochemical study using five phospho-NF-kappaB antibodies. Compared to non-SE animals (data not shown), 12 hr-post SE animals of the saline-infused group showed p65-Ser276, p65-Ser311, p65-Ser529, and p65-Ser536 phosphorylation in astrocytes (not endothelial cells). sTNFp55R infusion effectively reduced p65-Ser276 and p65-Ser311 phosphorylation (p < 0.05, respectively), while it could not affect p65-Ser529 or p65-Ser536 phosphorylation (Figures 3 and 4A). In contrast, p65-Thr435 phosphorylation was increased in endothelial cells (not astrocytes) within the PC of saline-infused animals 12 hr after SE (Figure 5A). In addition, sTNFp55R infusion effectively alleviated SE-induced p65-Thr435 phosphorylation in endothelial cells, compared to saline infusion (p < 0.05, Figure 5B).","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":54,"end":63},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":140,"end":149},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":368,"end":371},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":380,"end":383},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":392,"end":395},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":408,"end":411},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":475,"end":482},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":512,"end":515},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":527,"end":530},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":606,"end":609},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":620,"end":623},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":680,"end":683},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":841,"end":848},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":892,"end":895},"category":"Protein"}]}
