Activation of TLR4-Mediated NF-Kappa-B Signaling\nActivation of TLR4 induces the phosphorylation of inhibitor of kappa-B (IkappaB), which dissociates IkappaB with NF-kappa-B (NFkappaB). Then, NFkappaB translocates into the nucleus and activates and regulates the transcription of genes related to inflammatory responses. To detectd the activation of TLR4-mediated NFkappaB signaling, the phosphorylation of inhibitor of kappa-B (p-IkappaB) and activity of NFkappaB were measured by methods of Western Blots and EMSA. Results showed that the p-IkappaB increased at 6 hours after ICH (P < .05), peaked on 3 days after ICH, and maintained a high level on 7 days after ICH (P < .05, Figure 5). As expected, the activity of NFkappaB was also increased in the same manner as that of the p-IkappaB (Figure 4).","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":19,"end":23},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":68,"end":72},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":354,"end":358},"category":"Protein"}]}
