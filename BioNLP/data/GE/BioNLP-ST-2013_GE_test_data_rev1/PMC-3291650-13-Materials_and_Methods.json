Subsequently, samples were filtered through a 70 microm and 40 microm nylon mesh. For the preparation of BAL, trachea were canulated and airway lumen was flushed 4 times with HBSS with 1 mM EDTA. Cells were stained with monoclonal antibodies directed against MHC-II (I-A/I-E) FITC (M5/114.15.2), CD11c PerCP-Cy5.5 (N418), F4/80 APC (BM8), CD62L PE (MEL-14), Granzyme B FITC (NGZB) from eBiosciences and CD3 Molecular Complex Horizon v450 (17A2), Ly6C Horizon v450 (AL-21), Ly6G PE (1A8), CD11b APC-Cy7 (M1/70), CD8alpha PerCP (53-6.7), IFNgamma Alexa 647 (XMG1.2) and CD16/32 (2.4G2) from BD Pharmingen. Samples were acquired on a LSRII Cytometer and analyzed using FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences). Propidium iodide was used to discriminate between live and dead cells.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":55,"end":74},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":485,"end":490},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":504,"end":514},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":549,"end":552},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":619,"end":623},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":657,"end":665},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":682,"end":690},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":714,"end":718},"category":"Protein"}]}
