{"source_db":"PMC","source_id":"3320587","division_id":22,"section":"Discussion","text":"The transcription factor NFAT5 is the most evolutionarily divergent member of the Rel family of NFAT proteins [57]. Unlike the other NFAT proteins (NFATp, NFATc, NFAT3, and NFAT4), NFAT5 binds DNA as an obligate dimer in a fashion resembling NF-kappaB proteins [58], is calcineurin independent, and does not cooperate with the basic region-leucine zipper proteins Fos and Jun in gene activation ([59], [60], reviewed in [61]-[63]). To date, osmotic stress, integrin activation, and T cell-stimulation have been shown to regulate NFAT5 activity [59], [64], [65]. Based on our demonstration here that the host innate immune response to MTb infection induces MyD88-dependent upregulation of NFAT5 gene expression, we have expanded this list to include MTb as an additional stimulus. We have linked this observation to MTb-stimulated HIV-1 gene expression by showing that MTb enhances the replication of HIV-1 subtypes B and C via a direct interaction between NFAT5 and the viral promoter. Thus, HIV-1 has co-opted NFAT5, which is induced as part of the innate immune response to TB, for enhanced viral transcription/replication.\nNF-kappaB is activated after MTb engagement of PRRs [20], [66]. Multiple studies of HIV-1 activation have shown that initial recruitment of the NF-kappaB p50/p65 heterodimer to the HIV-1 proviral enhancer region is crucial for HIV gene transcription (reviewed in [67], [68]). Upon interaction with the viral LTR, NF-kappaB rapidly induces hyperacetylation of histones associated with nucleosome 1 (nuc-1) at the HIV-1 transcription start site, resulting in recruitment of the pTEFb complex, which is required for RNA pol II processivity ([69], reviewed in [68], [70]).\nIn this report we directly examined the relative roles of NFAT5 and NF-kappaB p50/p65 in HIV-1 replication under conditions of activation by MTb co-infection, when NF-kappaB levels in the nucleus are elevated. We found that specific disruption of the NFAT5 binding site(s) in R5-tropic subtype B or subtype C infectious molecular clones significantly reduced virus replication in PBMC or MDM co-infected with a clinical isolate of MTb. Thus, NF-kappaB binding to the viral LTR is not sufficient to compensate for the loss of NFAT5 binding to the LTR under conditions of MTb co-infection. Reciprocally, an intact NFAT5 site could not compensate for disruption of the two NF-kappaB sites. Thus, both factors are required for MTb-induced HIV-1 replication.\nIntriguingly, both in the absence and presence of MTb co-infection, disruption of NF-kappaB site II consistently resulted in greater suppression of virus replication than disruption of NF-kappaB site I. Consistent with these findings, synthetic reporter assays have previously shown that these two sites have distinct roles in driving transcription. The downstream NF-kappaB site I binding site, which is directly upstream of three highly conserved Sp binding sites, appears to enhance Sp protein recruitment to the LTR [71]-[73]. Because NF-kappaB site I overlaps the NFAT5 binding site, it is possible that loss of NF-kappaB binding to this site is mitigated, at least in part, by increased NFAT5 binding to the mutated site. This hypothesis is consistent with our quantitative DNase I footprinting analysis that shows that specific disruption of NF-kappaB site I results in enhanced binding of NFAT5 to the LTR.\nHIV-1 subtype C now makes up greater than 50% of all HIV-1 infections worldwide, and its prevalence is especially high in regions of endemic TB [1], [2], [28], [52], Most HIV-1 subtype C isolates possess three NF-kappaB binding sites in the LTR [30]. Our analysis of MTb whole lysate-stimulated, LTR-driven reporter gene expression from representative B, C, and E LTRs showed that LTRs derived from subtype C isolates were superior in driving reporter gene expression as compared to LTRs derived from subtype B or E isolates. Other studies have found that, in response to TNF, subtype C LTRs drive reporter gene transcription more strongly than other subtype LTRs [38], [39]. In the co-infection model utilized in this report, in which clinical isolates of both MTb and HIV-1 subtype C were used to infect freshly prepared human peripheral blood cells, we found that specific disruption of NFAT5 binding to the LTR significantly impaired viral replication during MTb co-infection, indicating that even the presence of three intact NF-kappaB binding sites, which is typical for HIV-1 subtype C isolates [30], cannot compensate for loss of NFAT5 recruitment to the viral LTR in the context of MTb co-infection.\nGiven that the NF-kappaB and NFAT5 binding motifs overlap, how do NF-kappaB and NFAT5 function at this overlapping or shared site in the LTR to drive viral transcription in response to MTb infection? Because NFAT5 expression continues to rise for at least 48 hours post-MTb infection (Figure 2A), one possibility is that the host factors NF-kappaB and NFAT5 associate with the LTR at different stages after viral activation. While NF-kappaB presence in the nucleus declines in the hours post MTb infection [74], [75], NFAT5 levels escalate. Thus, NFAT5, which is pivotal for HIV-1 transcription in unstimulated cells [31], may, after Mtb infection, perpetuate viral transcriptional initiation begun by NF-kappaB and, with Tat levels also elevated, promote high levels of sustained HIV-1 transcription. Indeed, in response to hypertonic stress, NFAT5 binds to the aldose reductase (AR) promoter and induces rapid hyperacetylation of histones H3 and H4 [76]. Furthermore, hypertonic stress of mouse renal collecting duct epithelial cells results in NFAT5 and NF-kappaB complex formation at NF-kappaB-dependent gene promoters [77]. Thus, there are precedents for imagining that NFAT5 could function at the HIV-1 LTR by inducing histone remodeling in a manner similar to NF-kappaB ([69], reviewed in [68], [70]) or by directly interacting with NF-kappaB in a cooperative manner.\nIn conclusion, we have demonstrated that NFAT5 is required for the replication of R5-tropic subtype B and subtype C HIV-1 isolates in response to MTb-co-infection of human PBMC and MDM. Functional NF-kappaB interaction with the viral LTR is also required, but fully intact NF-kappaB binding elements are unable to compensate for the loss of NFAT5 recruitment to the viral promoter. In addition, we have demonstrated that MTb infection or stimulation with the TLR2 ligand PAM3Cys, induces NFAT5 gene expression in human monocytes. Furthermore, we have shown that MTb stimulation of NFAT5 depends on TLR pathway signaling molecules, including MyD88, IRAK1, and TRAF6. Taken together, the findings presented here enhance the general understanding of the innate immune response to MTb infection by showing that NFAT5 is a major mediator of TLR-dependent gene expression; its importance for gene regulation is likely applicable to other MTb- and TLR-regulated genes. Moreover, these data provide molecular insights into MTb regulation of HIV-1 transcription, thereby elucidating several new targets for therapeutic interventions aimed at controlling TB/HIV-1 co-infection.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":25,"end":30},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":148,"end":153},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":155,"end":160},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":162,"end":167},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":173,"end":178},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":181,"end":186},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":270,"end":281},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":364,"end":367},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":372,"end":375},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":529,"end":534},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":656,"end":661},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":688,"end":693},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":956,"end":961},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1011,"end":1016},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1280,"end":1283},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1284,"end":1287},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1753,"end":1758},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1773,"end":1776},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1777,"end":1780},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":2220,"end":2225},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T34","span":{"begin":3142,"end":3147},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T35","span":{"begin":3229,"end":3236},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T36","span":{"begin":3346,"end":3351},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T37","span":{"begin":3936,"end":3939},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T38","span":{"begin":4254,"end":4259},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T39","span":{"begin":4502,"end":4507},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T40","span":{"begin":4653,"end":4658},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T41","span":{"begin":4781,"end":4786},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T42","span":{"begin":4925,"end":4930},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T43","span":{"begin":5091,"end":5096},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T44","span":{"begin":5120,"end":5125},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T45","span":{"begin":5295,"end":5298},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T46","span":{"begin":5417,"end":5422},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T47","span":{"begin":5436,"end":5452},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T48","span":{"begin":5454,"end":5456},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T49","span":{"begin":5620,"end":5625},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T50","span":{"begin":5748,"end":5753},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T51","span":{"begin":5989,"end":5994},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T52","span":{"begin":6145,"end":6154},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T53","span":{"begin":6289,"end":6294},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T54","span":{"begin":6407,"end":6411},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T55","span":{"begin":6436,"end":6441},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T56","span":{"begin":6529,"end":6534},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T57","span":{"begin":6589,"end":6594},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T58","span":{"begin":6596,"end":6601},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T59","span":{"begin":6607,"end":6612},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T60","span":{"begin":6755,"end":6760},"category":"Protein"}]}
