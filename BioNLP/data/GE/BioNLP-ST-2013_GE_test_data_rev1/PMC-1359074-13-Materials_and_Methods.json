The hybridization was performed in phosphate buffered 7% SDS hybridization solution. Blots were washed with 0.2x SSC, 1% SDS at 60 degreesC prior to exposure to X-ray film (Kodak, Rochester, New York, United States) at -80 degreesC for 6 d.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":129,"end":133},"category":"Protein"}]}
